# An LLM (Large Language Model)

This example demonstrates how BERT models artificial intelligence systems following Bertalanffy's principle that "complex systems exhibit emergent properties through the interaction of their parts." The LLM exemplifies all characteristics of Mobus's 7-tuple framework applied to artificial intelligence: components (embeddings, attention, layers), network (transformer architecture), governance (training objectives), boundary (context windows), transformation (text→understanding→text), history (training data), and temporal dynamics (autoregressive generation).
