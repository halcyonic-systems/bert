# BERT Platform

This example demonstrates how BERT models itself - a recursive application of systems science where a system modeling platform becomes the subject of its own analysis. Following Bertalanffy's principle that "systems science provides universal principles applicable across domains," BERT exemplifies how a technological system can model itself using the same frameworks it provides for analyzing other systems.
