# Meta-Systems

This category contains examples of systems that operate at conceptual or meta-levels - systems that model themselves, or templates that demonstrate universal system principles.

## Examples in this Category

### [BERT Platform](bert-platform.md)
- **Type**: Software system modeling itself
- **Complexity**: 19.7 (self-referential system coordination)
- **Domain**: Technology/Software Development
- **Key Insight**: Recursive system definition - a system for modeling systems

### [System Template](universal-system-template.md)
- **Type**: Generic system demonstrating universal principles
- **Complexity**: 18.4 (universal system template)
- **Domain**: Theoretical/Foundational
- **Key Insight**: Demonstrates Mobus 7-tuple framework across all domains

## Meta-System Characteristics

Meta-systems exhibit unique properties:
- **Self-reference**: Systems that can model or describe themselves
- **Universal principles**: Templates showing patterns across all domains  
- **Recursive definition**: Systems composed of systems following same principles
- **Conceptual abstraction**: Operating at higher levels of organization

These examples demonstrate how systems science provides frameworks that apply to systems studying systems - the recursive nature of systemness itself.
