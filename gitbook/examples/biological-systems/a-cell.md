# A Cell

This example demonstrates how BERT can model a biological cell as a complex adaptive system with inputs, outputs, and internal processes.

## Overview

The cell model showcases:
- **System boundary**: Cell membrane with controlled porosity
- **Input flows**: Glucose and oxygen for cellular respiration
- **Output flows**: ATP (primary product) and CO2 (waste product)
- **Interfaces**: Specialized molecular mechanisms for transport

## Key System Components

### 1. System Definition
- **Name**: Cell
- **Complexity**: Evolveable (can change structure over time)
- **Time Unit**: Seconds (cellular processes occur rapidly)

### 2. Boundary Configuration
- **Boundary**: Cell Membrane
- **Porosity**: 0.2 (selective permeability)
- **Perceptive Fuzziness**: 0.1 (clear boundary definition)

### 3. Input Pathways
- **Glucose Import**
  - Interface: Glucose Transporter (GLUT protein)
  - Flow: 1 unit of glucose per time unit
  - Source: Blood Vessel system
  
- **Oxygen Import**
  - Interface: Oxygen Diffusion Channel
  - Flow: 2 units of O2 per time unit
  - Source: Blood Vessel system

### 4. Output Pathways
- **ATP Production** (Primary Product)
  - Interface: ATP Synthase complex
  - Flow: 30 units of ATP per glucose
  - Sink: Cellular Processes (internal consumption)
  
- **CO2 Waste**
  - Interface: CO2 Diffusion Channel
  - Flow: 1 unit of CO2 per time unit
  - Sink: Blood Vessel system (removal)

## Learning Points

This model illustrates several key BERT concepts:

1. **Boundary Management**: The cell membrane acts as a selective barrier, controlling what enters and exits
2. **Transformation**: The cell transforms low-energy inputs (glucose + O2) into high-energy outputs (ATP)
3. **Waste Management**: Every system must handle waste products (CO2 in this case)
4. **Interface Specificity**: Each flow requires specific molecular mechanisms (transporters, channels, synthases)

## Try It Yourself

1. Load this model in BERT using the Model Browser
2. Explore the visual representation of flows and interfaces
3. Try modifying the flow rates to see how the system responds
4. Consider adding more detail like internal organelles or metabolic pathways

## Extensions

Consider extending this model by:
- Adding mitochondria as subsystems
- Modeling protein synthesis pathways
- Including cell division mechanisms
- Adding regulatory feedback loops
