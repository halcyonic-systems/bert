# Alpha

**Fall 2023 - July 2025**

## What We Built

A minimal viable research prototype that makes core concepts of System Language and Deep Systems Analysis accessible through technologyâ€”no longer requiring people to wade through theoretical textbooks.

## What We Learned

The prototype was perfect for theoretical systems scientists who could imagine future potential. But most users need to see to believe. Minor UI issues were interpreted as critical flaws.

The biggest limitation: inability to rapidly incorporate user feedback and make improvements on my own. BERT showed only static system representations when users craved dynamics.

## Why We Moved On

Alpha proved the concept. Beta brings the execution.
