# v0.3.0 - Agent Archetype

**Planned: Fall 2025**

## Features

### Agent Modeling
- **Agent Types** - Reactive, anticipatory, and intentional agents
- **Agent Architecture** - Computational engine, decision model, experiential memory
- **Visual Representation** - Hexagonal agent visualization with behavior indicators

### System Integration
- **Multi-Scale Modeling** - Agents at one scale, systems of agents at another
- **Bottom-Up Analysis** - Agent-based system emergence modeling
- **Scale Navigation** - Switch between agent and system views

## Technical

- Implementation of Mobus agent archetype theory
- Conservation-constrained agent behaviors
- Behavioral dynamics and decision-making modeling

## Value

Adds bottom-up perspective to complement BERT's top-down system decomposition.
