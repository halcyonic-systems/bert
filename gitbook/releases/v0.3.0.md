# v0.3.0 - Agent Archetype

**Planned: Late 2025**

## Overview

Major feature release introducing agent modeling capabilities based on George Mobus's agent archetype theory, enabling bottom-up systems analysis to complement BERT's top-down approach.

## Planned Features

### Agent Modeling
- **Agent Archetype Implementation** - Reactive, anticipatory, and intentional agent types
- **Three-Component Architecture** - Computational engine, decision model, experiential memory
- **Visual Representation** - Hexagonal agent visualization with behavior indicators

### Theoretical Integration
- **Mobus Agent Framework** - Implementation of systems science agent theory
- **Scale-Dependent Modeling** - Agents at one scale, systems of agents at another
- **Conservation-Constrained Intelligence** - Agent behaviors respecting physical laws

### Enhanced System Analysis
- **Bottom-Up Perspective** - Agent-based system emergence modeling
- **Multi-Scale Integration** - Seamless navigation between agent and system views
- **Behavioral Dynamics** - Decision-making and adaptation modeling

## Research Foundation

Based on comprehensive analysis of Mobus Systems Science chapters 10-11, integrating agent archetype theory with BERT's existing system modeling capabilities.

## Strategic Value

Completes BERT's theoretical foundation by adding the missing agent perspective, enabling comprehensive systems analysis that captures both structural decomposition and emergent behavior.
