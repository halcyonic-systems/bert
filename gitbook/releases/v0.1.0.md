# v0.1.0 - Foundation

**Released: Fall 2023 - July 2025**

## Overview

The foundational research prototype establishing core System Language concepts and Deep Systems Analysis methodology in software form.

## Key Features

- **Visual System Modeling** - Interactive system design with hierarchical decomposition
- **Deep Systems Analysis** - Implementation of rigorous systems science methodology  
- **Cross-Platform Architecture** - Web and desktop applications with Tauri + Leptos + Bevy
- **JSON Persistence** - Human-readable save/load system for system models

## What We Learned

- Theoretical systems scientists could imagine the potential
- Most users needed tangible examples to understand the value
- Static representations needed dynamic capabilities
- UI polish significantly impacts user perception

## Technical Foundation

- **Rust + Leptos + Bevy** architecture established
- **Entity-Component-System** (ECS) pattern for system modeling
- **Layer 4 System Language** implementation
- **Professional documentation standards** developed

## Impact

Proved that systems science theory could be made accessible through software tools, setting the foundation for practical systems analysis applications.
