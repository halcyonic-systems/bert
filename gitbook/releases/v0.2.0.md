# v0.2.0 - Professional Systems Analysis Platform

**Released: August 2025**

## Overview

Comprehensive upgrade transforming BERT into a research-grade systems science platform. Integrates Mobus's Deep Systems Analysis principles with professional UX design, making rigorous systems modeling accessible to researchers and practitioners.

## Key Features

### Spatial Interaction System
- **Boundary Region Interaction** - Click boundary rings to access boundary properties (porosity, perceptive fuzziness)
- **Environment Region Support** - Dedicated environmental context interaction following systems theory principles
- **Mobus DSA Alignment** - Boundaries as first-class entities, not visual decoration
- **Technical Reference**: `src/bevy_app/bundles/spawn/spatial_interaction.rs`

### Enhanced Model Library
- **Seven Theoretically-Grounded Models** - Cell, Organization, Solar Panel, LLM, Ecosystem, BERT Platform, System Template
- **Complexity Range** - 15.6 (Solar Panel) to 28.3 (LLM) demonstrating system diversity
- **Rich Descriptions** - Detailed component and flow documentation with systems science foundations
- **Cross-Domain Coverage** - Biological, social, technological, and meta-system examples
- **Model Browser Access** - All enhanced models available through one-click loading

### Context Help System
- **Progressive Disclosure Tooltips** - Question mark icons provide context-sensitive guidance
- **Systems Science Terminology** - Clear explanations of equivalence classes, complexity measures, system properties
- **Dual-Domain Examples** - Biological and organizational contexts for universal understanding

### Model Browser
- **One-Click Loading** - Immediate access to complete, professionally-crafted system models
- **No Manual Required** - Users learn through exploration of rich examples
- **Seven Enhanced Models** - Cell, Organization, Solar Panel, LLM, Ecosystem, BERT Platform, System Template
- **Meta-System Examples** - BERT modeling itself and universal system template demonstrating recursive principles

## Technical Improvements
