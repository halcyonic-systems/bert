# v0.2.2 - Smart Parameters & Enhanced Interaction

**Released: September 8, 2025**  
**Status: Collaborator Review Ready**

## Features

### Smart Parameters System (MVP)
- **Context-Aware Parameters** - Intelligent parameter suggestions based on substance type
- **Multiple Data Types** - Support for Numeric, Ordinal, Categorical, and Boolean parameters
- **Economic Analysis** - Built-in SCTG2 commodity codes and transport mode classifications
- **Auto-Synchronization** - Shipment Value parameters automatically sync with Flow.amount
- **Persistent Storage** - Parameters saved with models and restored on load

### Enhanced Element Clickability  
- **Improved Flow Targeting** - Flow line width increased from 3px to 6px (100% improvement)
- **Larger External Entities** - Sources and sinks increased ~148% in clickable area (70×170px vs 40×120px)
- **Better Interface Selection** - Interface elements increased ~40% in area (30×70px vs 24×60px)
- **Consistent Stroke Widths** - All element strokes enhanced for better visibility and interaction
- **Zoom Compatibility** - All sizing improvements scale proportionally across zoom levels

## User Experience Improvements

### Interaction Enhancements
- **Easier Element Selection** - Addresses user complaints about "difficult to click" elements
- **Visual-Click Alignment** - Better match between visual appearance and clickable areas
- **Responsive Feedback** - Visual feedback loops enhance system understanding

### Technical Excellence
- **Constants-Based Architecture** - All sizing through centralized constants for consistency
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal computational overhead for visual enhancements
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Web and desktop parity maintained

## Model Complexity Support

Enhanced support for complex system models through:
- **Feedback Loop Clarity** - Visual representation of system feedback relationships
- **Improved Interaction** - Easier manipulation of model elements
- **Scalable Design** - Features work across all zoom levels and system complexities

## Bug Fixes

### Intuitive Zoom Controls
- **Fixed Issue #3** - Plus (+) now zooms in, Minus (-) now zooms out (contributed by @Aaravthk)
- **Numpad Support** - Added NumpadAdd and NumpadSubtract key support
- **Standard Conventions** - Aligned with expected zoom behavior

### Subsystem Size Calculation
- **73% Size Reduction** - More efficient canvas space usage
- **Interface Subsystems** - Properly account for contained interfaces
- **Visual Hierarchy** - Improved layout consistency

## Developer Experience

- **BERT Contributing Standards** - Full compliance with documentation and commit conventions
- **Feature Branch Architecture** - Clean separation of enhancement features
- **Code Quality Assurance** - All changes pass clippy linting and formatting checks
- **First External Contribution** - Successfully integrated community PR

## Notes

- Feedback visualization deferred to v0.2.3 for quality focus
- Smart Parameters are MVP - additional types planned for future releases
