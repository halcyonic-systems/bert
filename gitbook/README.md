# Get Started with BERT

**BERT** (Bounded Entity Reasoning Toolkit) is a visual software tool that guides analysts through the rigorous decomposition and analysis of complex adaptive systems.

Modern systems are increasingly interconnected and difficult to understand through conventional analysis. BERT implements [George Mobus's](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus) Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) methodology to:

* Systematically decompose complex systems into manageable components
* Preserve critical flows, interfaces, and relationships between components  
* Capture knowledge in a standardized, computable format
* Build hierarchical models with unlimited decomposition levels

Unlike traditional diagramming tools, BERT enforces methodological rigor based on systems science principles.

## Getting Started <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>

The fastest way to start using BERT is through our web application: üåê [bert.systems](https://bert.systems/)‚Äã

For desktop applications with offline capabilities, download the version for your operating system:

* ‚Äã[MacOS Apple Silicon](https://github.com/halcyonic-systems/bert/releases/download/v0.1.0-beta/bert_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg)‚Äã
* ‚Äã[MacOS Intel](https://github.com/halcyonic-systems/bert/releases/download/v0.1.0-beta/bert_0.1.0_x64.dmg)‚Äã
* ‚Äã[Windows](https://github.com/halcyonic-systems/bert/releases/download/v0.1.0-beta/bert.exe)‚Äã


## Learning Path <a href="#learning-path" id="learning-path"></a>

If you're new to BERT, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start with the [Creating Your First System](getting-started/creating-your-first-system/) tutorial
2. Learn about the [Core System Elements](getting-started/creating-your-first-system/system-elements.md)
3. Learn the Essential [Controls and Interface](getting-started/controls-and-interface.md)
4. Explore [System Decomposition](getting-started/creating-your-first-system/step-11-system-decomposition.md)
5. Practice with our [Example Analyses](getting-started/examples/)

## Theoretical Foundation

BERT is built on the systems science work of [George Mobus](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus), particularly:

* **Deep Systems Analysis (DSA)** - A rigorous methodology for analyzing complex systems
* **System Ontology** - The 7-tuple formal definition of system (from *Principles of Systems Science*)  
* **System Language** - The vision for a formal language of systems (from *Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling, and Design*)

BERT represents a first implementation of these theoretical concepts, making them accessible through visual software tools. For researchers interested in the formal foundations, see the [For Researchers](for-researchers/) section.
