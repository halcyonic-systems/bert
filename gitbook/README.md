# Get Started with BERT

**BERT** (Bounded Entity Reasoning Toolkit) is a visual software tool that guides analysts through the rigorous decomposition and analysis of complex adaptive systems.

Modern systems are increasingly interconnected and difficult to understand through conventional analysis. BERT implements Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) methodology to:

* Systematically decompose complex systems into manageable components
* Preserve critical flows, interfaces, and relationships between components  
* Capture knowledge in a standardized, computable format
* Build hierarchical models with unlimited decomposition levels

Unlike traditional diagramming tools, BERT enforces methodological rigor based on systems science principles.

## Learning Path <a href="#learning-path" id="learning-path"></a>

If you're new to BERT, we recommend following this learning path:

1. Start with the [Creating Your First System](getting-started/creating-your-first-system/) tutorial
2. Learn about the [Core System Elements](getting-started/creating-your-first-system/system-elements.md)
3. Learn the Essential [Controls and Interface](getting-started/controls-and-interface.md)
4. Explore [System Decomposition](getting-started/creating-your-first-system/step-11-system-decomposition.md)
5. Practice with our [Example Analyses](getting-started/examples/)
