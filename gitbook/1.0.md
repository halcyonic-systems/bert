# 1.0

**Target: Early-Mid 2026**

## The Vision

Simulations. Generate ABM and SD models directly from system descriptions built through the DSA process.

## Why It Matters

Integration of disparate systems science methodologies. One tool where information theory, cybernetics, ABM, SD, and other approaches complement each other for multi-methodological analysis.

**THE SYSTEMISCOPE FOR SYSTEMS SCIENTISTS**

## What 1.0 Enables

- Build your system model visually
- Generate simulations automatically
- Switch between methodological lenses
- True systems science integration

The dream: systems scientists spend time thinking about systems, not wrestling with incompatible tools.
