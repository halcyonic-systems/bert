# BERT Development for Systems Scientists

This guide bridges the gap between systems science theory and BERT's code implementation, helping systems scientists understand and extend the platform.

## Understanding BERT's Theoretical Foundation

BERT (Bounded Entity Reasoning Toolkit) implements a formal System Language (SL) to model complex adaptive systems. It provides:

1. **Visual system representation** - Graphical modeling of system components and relationships
2. **Hierarchical decomposition** - Multi-level system analysis and navigation  
3. **Structured knowledge capture** - Standardized data models for system properties
4. **Collaborative system sharing** - Standardized JSON format for model exchange

## Systems Concepts Mapped to Code Implementation

Each theoretical concept from systems science has a direct implementation in BERT's codebase:

| Systems Concept | BERT Implementation | File Location |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **System** | `SystemComponent` | `src/bevy_app/components/system_elements.rs` |
| **Subsystem** | `SubsystemComponent` | `src/bevy_app/components/system_elements.rs` |
| **Flow** | `FlowComponent` | `src/bevy_app/components/connections.rs` |
| **Interface** | `InterfaceComponent` | `src/bevy_app/components/connections.rs` |
| **Boundary** | Visual container logic | `src/bevy_app/bundles/spawn/` |
| **External Entity** | `ExternalEntityComponent` | `src/bevy_app/components/system_elements.rs` |

## Extending BERT for Research Applications

### Adding New System Properties

If your research requires additional system properties (like resilience metrics, complexity indices, or domain-specific attributes):

**Step 1: Update the Data Model**
```rust
// In src/bevy_app/components/system_elements.rs
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct SystemComponent {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    // Add your research properties here
    pub resilience_score: f32,
    pub complexity_index: u32,
    pub research_notes: String,
}
```

**Step 2: Update the User Interface**
```rust
// In src/leptos_app/details.rs (system element editor)
<Slider
    label="Resilience Score"
    min=0.0
    max=10.0
    step=0.1
    value=resilience_score
/>
```

**Step 3: Update Data Persistence**
```rust
// In src/bevy_app/data_model/save.rs and load.rs
// Ensure new properties are included in serialization
```

### Creating Domain-Specific Element Types

For specialized research domains, you can add new element types:

```rust
// In src/bevy_app/components/system_elements.rs
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ResearchElementComponent {
    pub element_type: ResearchType,
    pub domain_properties: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub methodology_notes: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum ResearchType {
    CognitiveProcess,
    SocialNetwork,
    EcologicalNiche,
    // Add domain-specific types
}
```

## Research Methodology Integration

### Connecting BERT to Research Workflows

**Data Export for Analysis:**
- BERT's JSON format enables integration with research tools
- System properties can be extracted for statistical analysis
- Network structures can be exported for graph analysis

**Collaborative Research:**
- Standardized system models facilitate peer review
- Version control enables iterative model development
- Shared vocabularies improve research communication

**Validation and Testing:**
- Models can be tested against empirical data
- Comparative analysis across different system representations
- Hypothesis testing through model manipulation

## Practical Research Applications

### Case Study: Organizational Systems Research

```rust
// Custom organizational properties
pub struct OrganizationComponent {
    pub org_type: OrganizationType,
    pub hierarchy_level: u32,
    pub decision_authority: DecisionScope,
    pub communication_patterns: Vec<CommunicationFlow>,
}
```

### Case Study: Ecological Systems Analysis

```rust  
// Ecological system properties
pub struct EcosystemComponent {
    pub biodiversity_index: f32,
    pub energy_flow_rate: f32,
    pub stability_metrics: StabilityData,
    pub species_interactions: Vec<InteractionType>,
}
```

## Getting Started with BERT Development

### For Systems Scientists New to Coding

1. **Start with conceptual mapping** - Understand how your theoretical concepts map to BERT's components
2. **Modify existing properties** - Begin by adding simple properties to existing components
3. **Extend the UI gradually** - Add interface elements for your new properties
4. **Test with real data** - Validate your extensions with actual research data

### Development Environment Setup

Follow the [Developer Getting Started Guide](../../for-developers/getting-started.md) for environment setup, then:

1. **Create a research branch**: `git checkout -b research/your-domain`
2. **Document your extensions**: Use the feature documentation tools
3. **Test extensively**: Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Share your work**: Consider contributing useful extensions back to the community

## Research Support and Community

- **Theoretical Questions**: Consult the [Deep Systems Analysis](deep-systems-analysis.md) methodology
- **Implementation Questions**: Check the [Developer Resources](../../for-developers/)  
- **Community Discussion**: Join research discussions in the BERT community
- **Academic Collaboration**: Consider formal collaboration opportunities

## Advanced Research Extensions

### Integration with Analysis Tools

BERT's JSON format enables integration with:
- **R/Python**: Statistical analysis of system properties
- **NetworkX**: Graph analysis of system relationships  
- **Gephi**: Network visualization and analysis
- **SPSS/SAS**: Advanced statistical modeling

### Custom Visualization

For research-specific visualizations:
- Extend BERT's Bevy rendering system
- Create domain-specific visual representations
- Add export capabilities for publication-ready graphics
