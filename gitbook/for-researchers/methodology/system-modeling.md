# System Modeling

This guide covers the theoretical foundations and practical methodology for analyzing and representing systems in BERT using formal system models.

## Analysis Philosophy

BERT implements George Mobus's Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) framework, providing a rigorous approach to system analysis constrained by the formal 7-tuple model of system:

- **Hierarchical Structure** - Systems decomposed into nested subsystems
- **Functional Organization** - Purpose-driven component relationships
- **Process Dynamics** - Flows of matter, energy, and information
- **Boundary Definitions** - Clear delineation of system scope

## Current Analysis Capabilities

BERT v0.2.0 supports structural system analysis with:

### Core Components (7-tuple based)
- **System Definition** - Name, purpose, and complexity metrics
- **Subsystems** - Hierarchical component decomposition
- **Connections** - Relationships between components
- **Boundaries** - System delimitation and interfaces
- **Environment** - External context and interactions

### Analysis Process
1. **Identify System Purpose** - What the system accomplishes
2. **Decompose Components** - Discover subsystems and elements
3. **Trace Relationships** - How components interact
4. **Delimit Boundaries** - What's inside vs outside
5. **Map Flows** - Matter, energy, and information exchanges

## Practical Examples

See our [Examples Library](../../examples/README.md) for complete system models:
- Biological systems (Cell, Ecosystem)
- Social systems (Organization)
- Technological systems (Solar Panel, LLM)
- Meta-systems (BERT Platform, Universal Template)

## Advanced Topics

For deeper exploration:
- [System Ontology](../system-ontology.md) - Theoretical foundations
- [System Language](../system-language.md) - Formal notation and semantics
- [Complexity Metrics](../../getting-started/interface-guide.md#complexity-counter) - Quantifying system properties

## Next Steps

- Start with the [Quick Start Guide](../../README.md#quick-start)
- Explore [pre-built models](../../examples/README.md)
- Create your own models using the [interface guide](../../getting-started/interface-guide.md)

*Future releases will expand these capabilities with dynamic simulation and analysis tools.*
