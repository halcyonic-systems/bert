# System Simulation

BERT's simulation capabilities are currently in development. This page will document how to use BERT for dynamic system simulations once these features are released.

## Coming in v0.3.0

The next major release of BERT will introduce dynamic simulation capabilities, enabling:

- **System Dynamics Modeling** - Stock and flow diagrams with differential equations
- **Agent-Based Modeling** - Individual agent behaviors and emergent patterns
- **Network Dynamics** - Evolution of network structures over time
- **Hybrid Simulations** - Combining SD, ABM, and network approaches

## Current Capabilities

While full simulation is not yet available, BERT v0.2.0 provides:

- **Structural Analysis** - Define system architecture and relationships
- **Complexity Metrics** - Quantify system complexity across dimensions
- **Interactive Visualization** - Real-time 2D system structure exploration
- **Model Templates** - Pre-built examples demonstrating system patterns
