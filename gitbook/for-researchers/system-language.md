# System Language

##

In the next section, we'll look at how the System Language (SL) formalizes these concepts and provides a rigorous framework for system analysis.

## System Language (SL) Foundation

This page explains the formal System Language that underlies BERT and provides its methodological rigor.

### The Need for a Formal Systems Language

Traditional modeling languages often fall short when representing complex systems:

* Many focus on static structure but miss dynamic relationships
* Some capture flows but not hierarchical decomposition
* Others lack the rigor needed for computational validation
* Most don't address the unique properties of adaptive systems

System Language (SL) was developed to address these gaps, creating a unified approach to systems representation.

### SL Components and Grammar

The fundamental building blocks of System Language:

* System elements and their ontological foundations
* Relationship types and their semantics
* Hierarchical representation rules
* Validation constraints

### Visual Representation in BERT

How BERT implements System Language visually:

* Graphical notation standards
* Visual grammar rules
* Relationship representation
* Layout conventions and meaning

### Computational Properties

How System Language enables computational analysis:

* Mathematical foundations
* Computational verification
* Simulation capabilities
* Formal validation

### Theoretical Background

BERT implements ideas from [George Mobus's](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus) work on systems science. After an interdisciplinary career spanning naval engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, energy systems modeling, and systems science, Mobus identified key limitations in standard systems modeling frameworks like [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-online.aspx) and [UML](https://www.uml.org/)/[SysML](https://sysml.org/).

To address these gaps, he proposed the creation of a new formal "System Language" (SL) grounded in systems science principles. BERT represents a first step toward developing this formal systems language, built specifically for modern systems scientists.
