# System Language

## System Language (SL) Foundation

This page explains the System Language concept that inspired BERT's development and provides its theoretical grounding.

### The Vision for System Language

As described in Chapter 4 of *Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling, and Design*, Mobus proposes developing an "explicit system language to take systemese public" - a formal language that is both machine and human readable for communicating system descriptions.

### The Need for a Formal Systems Language

Traditional modeling languages often fall short when representing complex systems:

* Many focus on static structure but miss dynamic relationships
* Some capture flows but not hierarchical decomposition
* Others lack the rigor needed for computational validation
* Most don't address the unique properties of adaptive systems

System Language aims to address these gaps, creating a unified approach based on the "systemese hypothesis" - that human thought is fundamentally structured around system concepts.

### SL Components and Grammar

| Component | Description | Theoretical Source |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Lexical Elements** | Primitive ontological elements (boundaries, flows, processes) | Section 4.3 |
| **Verbal Descriptions** | Structured statements mapping to system relations | Fig. 4.2 |
| **Visual Icons** | Graphical representations of system elements | Fig. 4.13 |
| **Component Tables** | Structured descriptions with predefined types | Table 4.1 |

### BERT's Implementation of SL Concepts

| SL Concept | BERT Implementation |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Visual Grammar** | Icons and graphical elements for system components |
| **Hierarchical Structure** | Recursive decomposition matching SL's formal definition |
| **Boundary Definitions** | Explicit system boundaries and interfaces |
| **Flow Specification** | Typed flows (matter, energy, information) with parameters |

*Note: BERT represents an accessible implementation of SL concepts to inspire and attract support for formal language specification. The full formal SL specification remains under development.*

### Computational Properties

System Language's design enables computational analysis through:

* **Mathematical Foundations** - Formal set-theoretic definitions enable rigorous analysis
* **Machine Readability** - Structured format allows automated processing and validation
* **Simulation Support** - Clear semantics enable dynamic system simulation
* **Verification Capabilities** - Formal structure permits consistency checking

*BERT demonstrates these capabilities through its complexity calculator, save/load functionality, and structured JSON format.*

### Theoretical Background

BERT implements ideas from [George Mobus's](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus) work on systems science. After an interdisciplinary career spanning naval engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, energy systems modeling, and systems science, Mobus identified key limitations in standard systems modeling frameworks like [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-online.aspx) and [UML](https://www.uml.org/)/[SysML](https://sysml.org/).

To address these gaps, he proposed the creation of a new formal "System Language" (SL) grounded in systems science principles. BERT represents a first step toward developing this formal systems language, built specifically for modern systems scientists.
