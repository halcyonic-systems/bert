# System Ontology

The theoretical foundations underlying BERT's approach to system representation and analysis.

## Foundation: Mobus's Ontological Framework

BERT implements the ontological framework from Chapter 3.4 of *Principles of Systems Science*, which asserts that "what can exist in this evolving Universe, made of matter and energy, organized by knowledge and information, is systems."

### The Core Framework

As outlined in Section 3.4, the framework establishes three aspects:
1. **Ontological Elements** - The things that exist in all systems
2. **Roles** - The functions these elements play  
3. **Hierarchical Organization** - The relative levels of system organization

### Implemented Elements in BERT

From the framework (Fig. 3.13), BERT v0.2.0 implements these core ontological elements:

#### Level -1: ENVIRONMENT
- **Definition**: "The supra-system that encloses the system of interest"
- **BERT Implementation**: Explicit environment field with spatial regions
- **Purpose**: Provides CONTEXT and MEANING to the system

#### Level 0: SYSTEM  
- **Identity Attributes** (partially implemented):
  - ENTITY - System name and definition
  - PROCESS - Purpose/function specification
  - ARCHETYPE - System type/category (implicit in examples)
- **Derived Properties**:
  - BEHAVIOR - Emerges from component interactions
  - BOUNDEDNESS - Explicit boundary definitions with spatial regions

#### Level +1: COMPONENTS
- **Definition**: "Internal components and their interactionsâ€”that which gives rise to the SOI behavior"
- **BERT Implementation**: Hierarchical subsystem decomposition
- **Relationships**: Component INTERACTIONS via connections

### The Principle of Systemness

Following Chapter 2, Principle 1: "Everything is a system, meaning that all things in existence are organized with system attributes and are, themselves, subsystems of larger supra-systems, up to the Universe as a whole."

BERT enables this recursive analysis where any COMPONENT at Level +1 can become the SYSTEM at Level 0 for deeper analysis.

## Theoretical Extensions

Future versions will expand the ontological implementation:
- **Temporal dynamics** (v0.3.0 - simulation features)
- **Process flows** (v0.3.0 - matter/energy/information)
- **Emergent properties** (v0.4.0 - pattern detection)
- **Cross-scale interactions** (v1.0.0 - multi-level dynamics)
