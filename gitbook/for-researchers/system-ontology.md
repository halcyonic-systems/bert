# System Ontology

The theoretical foundations underlying BERT's approach to system representation and analysis.

##  Quick Start: Explore the Formal Ontology

**Download & explore BERT's formal ontology specification:**

### Option 1: Protégé Desktop (Recommended)
1. **Download Protégé**: https://protege.stanford.edu/download/protege/5.6.4/
2. **Open ontology**: File → Open → Select [`bert-systems-ontology.rdf`](bert-systems-ontology.rdf)
3. **Explore classes**: Use "Classes" tab to navigate the system hierarchy
4. **Visualize**: Window → Tabs → OntoGraf for interactive graph view

### Option 2: WebVOWL (No Installation)
1. **Visit**: https://service.tib.eu/webvowl/
2. **Upload**: [`bert-systems-ontology.rdf`](bert-systems-ontology.rdf)
3. **Explore**: Interactive graph showing all relationships

## Foundation: Mobus's Ontological Framework

BERT implements the ontological framework from Chapter 3.4 of *Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling, and Design*, which asserts that "what can exist in this evolving Universe, made of matter and energy, organized by knowledge and information, is systems."

### The Core Framework

As outlined in Section 3.4, the framework establishes three aspects:
1. **Ontological Elements** - The things that exist in all systems
2. **Roles** - The functions these elements play  
3. **Hierarchical Organization** - The relative levels of system organization

### Implemented Elements in BERT

From the framework (Fig. 3.13), BERT v0.2.0 implements these core ontological elements:

#### Level -1: ENVIRONMENT
- **Definition**: "The supra-system that encloses the system of interest"
- **BERT Implementation**: Explicit environment field with spatial regions
- **Purpose**: Provides CONTEXT and MEANING to the system

#### Level 0: SYSTEM  
- **Identity Attributes** (partially implemented):
  - ENTITY - System name and definition
  - PROCESS - Purpose/function specification
  - ARCHETYPE - System type/category (implicit in examples)
- **Derived Properties**:
  - BEHAVIOR - Emerges from component interactions
  - BOUNDEDNESS - Explicit boundary definitions with spatial regions

#### Level +1: COMPONENTS
- **Definition**: "Internal components and their interactions—that which gives rise to the SOI behavior"
- **BERT Implementation**: Hierarchical subsystem decomposition
- **Relationships**: Component INTERACTIONS via connections

### The Principle of Systemness

Following Chapter 2, Principle 1: "Everything is a system, meaning that all things in existence are organized with system attributes and are, themselves, subsystems of larger supra-systems, up to the Universe as a whole."

BERT enables this recursive analysis where any COMPONENT at Level +1 can become the SYSTEM at Level 0 for deeper analysis.

## Formal Ontology Specification

BERT's theoretical foundations are formalized in a complete OWL/RDF ontology that maps Mobus's 7-tuple framework to computational implementation:

**📄 [bert-systems-ontology.rdf](bert-systems-ontology.rdf)** - Complete formal ontology specification

This ontology provides:
- **Semantic Validation** - Formal verification of system models against systems theory
- **Protégé Compatibility** - Load directly into ontology editors for analysis  
- **JSON Mapping** - Direct correspondence between formal concepts and BERT's JSON implementation
- **Mobus 7-tuple Implementation** - Complete mapping of S_{i,l} = ⟨C_{i,l}, N_{i,l}, G_{i,l}, B_{i,l}, T_{i,l}, H_{i,l}, Δ_{i,l}⟩

### Integration with BERT Models

The ontology provides semantic validation for BERT's JSON models:
