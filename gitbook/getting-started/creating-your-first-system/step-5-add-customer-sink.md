# Step 5: Add Customer Sink

### External Entities

**External entities** represent systems or actors that are distinct from your SOI but interact with it in important ways that are relevant for the purposes of analysis.&#x20;

**Examples include:**

* People (customers, users, operators)
* Organizations (suppliers, regulators)
* Other systems (external infrastructure, natural environment)

**Key characteristics:**

* Exist outside your system boundary
* Exchange materials, energy, or information with your system
* Have their own internal workings (which you may choose not to model)

We'll start by creating a **customer sink** an environmental identity that receives and makes use of your system's core product.&#x20;
