# Step 1: Starting a New Project

When you first open BERT, you'll be presented with a blank canvas containing a main system circle.

1. This circle represents your system of interest - no explicit "new project" step is needed
2. Notice the subtle gray ring around the system - this shows your system boundary
3. You can begin working immediately with this blank system
4. If you want to open an existing project instead, press `Ctrl+L`

ðŸ’¡ **What you're seeing**: The gray boundary ring helps you visualize where your system ends and its environment begins. As you zoom in and out (using `=` and `-` keys), this boundary stays properly positioned with your system.
