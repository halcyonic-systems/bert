# Step 8: Traverse The Boundary

## Systematic Boundary Analysis

Now that you've identified initial flows, systematically traverse the entire boundary to ensure complete analysis:

**Identify Missing Flows**: Look for additional inputs and outputs by examining the full boundary perimeter.

**Add New Arrows**: Use the green arrows to connect any additional sources and sinks you discover.

**Validate Flow Types**: Ensure each flow is properly categorized as matter, energy, or information.

**Check Completeness**: Ask yourself: "What else does this system need to function?" and "What other outputs does it produce?"

## Tips for Thoroughness

- Consider waste products and byproducts
- Look for information flows (control signals, feedback)
- Don't forget maintenance inputs (replacement parts, updates)
- Consider seasonal or cyclical inputs/outputs

Complete boundary traversal ensures your model captures the full system context before moving to internal decomposition.
