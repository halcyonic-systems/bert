# Step 8: Review and Validate Your System

## Does Your System Make Sense?

You've now mapped your system's key flows - primary output, waste, and inputs - along with their interfaces and sources/sinks. Time to step back and validate: does this tell a coherent story about how your system works?

## Review Your Flow Logic

Look at your complete model and ask these critical questions:

**Input-Output Balance**: Do your inputs provide what's needed to create your outputs?

**Examples from our model library:**
- **Cell**: Glucose + Oxygen â†’ Energy + CO2 + Water âœ“
- **Ecosystem**: Sunlight + Nutrients â†’ Biomass + Dead matter âœ“  
- **Solar Panel**: Solar radiation â†’ Electricity + Heat âœ“
- **Organization**: Materials + Labor â†’ Products + Overhead âœ“
- **LLM**: Prompts + Training data â†’ Generated text + Computational heat âœ“

**Interface Consistency**: Do your interfaces make sense for the flows they handle?
- Are input interfaces designed to receive what your sources provide?
- Are output interfaces designed to deliver what your sinks need?

**Waste Accounting**: Does your waste make logical sense given your inputs and processes?

## Validation Questions

**Energy/Resource Conservation**: Where does the energy/matter come from and go to?

**Purpose Alignment**: Do your inputs support creating your primary output?

**Environmental Fit**: Do your sources and sinks exist in the same environment as your system?

**Missing Elements**: Are there obvious inputs or outputs you haven't accounted for?

## What to Look For

**Red flags that suggest revision needed:**
- Outputs that require inputs you haven't identified
- Interfaces that don't match their flows
- Sources/sinks that seem disconnected from your system's environment
- Imbalanced resource accounting (more output than input, or vice versa)

**Good signs your model is coherent:**
- Clear transformation story from inputs to outputs
- Interfaces that make sense for their context
- Balanced resource accounting
- All flows have logical sources and destinations

## Next Steps

Once your input-output story makes sense, you're ready to look inside your system and understand how it actually transforms inputs into outputs through internal processes and subsystems.

> ðŸ”‘ **Systems thinking**: A valid system model tells a believable story about transformation - how inputs become outputs through the system's processes, with waste as a natural byproduct. If your story has gaps, revisit your flows before proceeding to internal analysis.
