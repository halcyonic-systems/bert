### Common Questions

<details>

<summary><strong>What if I can't see the main system circle?</strong></summary>

If your canvas appears empty, try:

* Checking if you're zoomed in too far (press `-` to zoom out)
* Resetting the camera position (press `Ctrl+R`)
* Look for the gray boundary ring - this can help you locate your system
* Restarting your project if the issue persists

<summary><strong>How many external entities should I add?</strong></summary>

Include all important external systems or actors that directly interact with your system of interest. For a beginner model, aim for 3-7 external entities to keep things manageable. You can always add more later.

<summary><strong>Can I change the position of elements after placing them?</strong></summary>

Yes! Simply click on an element to select it, then click and drag to move it to a new position. You can also select multiple elements by holding Shift while clicking on them, then move them as a group.

<summary><strong>What are the gray rings around my systems?</strong></summary>

Those are boundary regions that show where your system ends and its environment begins. They help you visualize system boundaries and automatically stay positioned correctly when you zoom in or out. You can click on a boundary ring to select its system.
