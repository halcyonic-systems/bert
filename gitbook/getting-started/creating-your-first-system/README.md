# Starting Your First Analysis

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use BERT to analyze your first system by defining boundaries, identifying components, and mapping relationships.

## What You'll Learn

* Define system boundaries
* Identify key components
* Map flows between elements
* Navigate hierarchical levels

Open BERT in your browser at [bert.systems](https://bert.systems) or download the desktop version to get started.



### Common Questions

<details>

<summary><strong>What if I can't see the main system circle?</strong></summary>

If your canvas appears empty, try:

* Checking if you're zoomed in too far (press `-` to zoom out)
* Resetting the camera position (press `Ctrl+R`)
* Look for the gray boundary ring - this can help you locate your system
* Restarting your project if the issue persists

<summary><strong>How many external entities should I add?</strong></summary>

Include all important external systems or actors that directly interact with your system of interest. For a beginner model, aim for 3-7 external entities to keep things manageable. You can always add more later.

<summary><strong>Can I change the position of elements after placing them?</strong></summary>

Yes! Simply click on an element to select it, then click and drag to move it to a new position. You can also select multiple elements by holding Shift while clicking on them, then move them as a group.
