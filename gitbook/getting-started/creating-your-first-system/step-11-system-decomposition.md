# Step 11: System Decomposition

## Principles of System Decomposition

System decomposition follows key principles from Deep Systems Analysis:

**Purpose-Driven**: Break systems down based on functional purposes, not arbitrary divisions.

**Boundary Preservation**: Each subsystem must have clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces.

**Recursive Structure**: Any component can be further analyzed as a system itself, following the same methodology.

**Flow Conservation**: All inputs and outputs must be accounted for across decomposition levels.

## Next Steps

With your system properly decomposed, you've completed the core BERT analysis workflow. You can now:

- Export your model using Ctrl+S
- Create additional systems using the same methodology  
- Explore [advanced examples](../examples/) for complex system patterns

*This tutorial series demonstrates BERT's systematic approach to understanding complex systems through rigorous decomposition.*
