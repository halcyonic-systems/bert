# Step 11: Go Deeper with Recursive Analysis

## Your First Complete System Model

You've built your first complete system model with:
- **External relationships** - inputs, outputs, waste, sources, and sinks
- **Boundary management** - specialized handlers for each interface
- **Internal processing** - subsystems that transform inputs into outputs

You now understand how your system works at a high level.

## Every Subsystem is Itself a System

Here's where BERT becomes really powerful: **every subsystem you've created can be analyzed as a system in its own right.** 

Click on any subsystem to make it your new system of interest (SOI) and start the analysis process again at a deeper level.

## Going Deeper - When and How

**Which subsystems to analyze first:**

**Start with the most critical or mysterious ones:**
- **Internal processors** that do complex transformations
- **Boundary handlers** that seem to do a lot of work
- **Subsystems** you're trying to improve or understand better

**Examples from our model library:**
- **Cell**: Click on "Mitochondria" to understand cellular energy production
- **Organization**: Click on "Manufacturing" to understand production processes
- **Solar Panel**: Click on "Photovoltaic Cells" to understand energy conversion
- **LLM**: Click on "Attention Mechanism" to understand how it processes information

## The Recursive Process

When you click on a subsystem, you restart Steps 1-10 **within that subsystem:**

1. **Define the subsystem** as your new system of interest
2. **Identify its outputs** - what does this subsystem produce for other parts of your system?
3. **Map its interfaces** - how does it connect to other subsystems?
4. **Add its waste** - what byproducts does this subsystem create?
5. **Identify its inputs** - what does this subsystem need from others?
6. **Validate the logic** - does the input-output story make sense?
7. **Add boundary handlers** - how does this subsystem manage its connections?
8. **Add internal processors** - what components work inside this subsystem?

## When to Stop Decomposing

You can continue this process indefinitely, but stop when:
- **You understand enough** for your analysis goals
- **Further detail doesn't help** your decision-making
- **You reach atomic components** that can't be meaningfully decomposed further

- Load complex systems that show multiple levels of decomposition
- Study how different domains handle hierarchical analysis
- Learn patterns for effective system modeling

## Systems Analysis Mastery

You've learned the fundamentals of systems analysis with BERT. You can now:

- Analyze any complex system using the recursive methodology you've learned
- Build comprehensive models that capture both structure and relationships  
- Navigate between levels to focus on the right level of detail for your needs

The power of systems analysis comes from understanding that every complex system is made of simpler systems, which are themselves made of even simpler systems. You now have the tools to navigate this hierarchy and understand systems at any level of detail.

Click on any subsystem in your model to continue your analysis!
