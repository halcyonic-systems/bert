# Step 3: Identify Primary Output

## Identifying your System's Core "Product"

After we have identified our SOI our next step is to identify its primary product output flow. &#x20;

All systems can be understood as dynamic entities that operate over time scales. To maintain themselves as systems, as opposed to disconnected parts, they must continuously:



1. Receive inputs
2. Process those inputs
3. Create outputs that are useful to some entity in its environment, which consists of other systems.&#x20;



Ask yourself â€” what is the purpose of your system. What is the most important thing that it creates?

Of course, most complex adaptive systems we are interested in will have multiple important purposes and outputs, but for the sake of simplicity we begin our analysis by identifying a single one that feels most relevant given our objectives.&#x20;

Systems analysis is a blend of art and science, and there are many stages like this where subjectivity comes into play. What's important is that we are transparent with ourselves and others about when we are making subjective choices.&#x20;

Once you've identified what the core product is, it's time to name it and  specify its nature as a flow.&#x20;

**Flows** represent the measurable **materials**, **energy**, or **information** that move within your system and between your system and its environment&#x20;
