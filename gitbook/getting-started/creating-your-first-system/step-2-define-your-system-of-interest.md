# Step 2: Define Your System of Interest

## Choose a System Worth Understanding

BERT is most useful when you have a real-world system that is complex, that you're deeply interested in, and that you either want to deepen your understanding of how it works, or share your understanding with others.

Think about a system that matters to you. It might be:
- Something you work with daily but don't fully understand
- A system you're trying to improve or fix
- Something you need to explain to colleagues or students
- A complex process you're curious about

## Name and Define Your System

Click on the main system circle. This opens the details panel where you'll define what you're analyzing.

**Give your system a clear name and purpose.** This is essential for grounding a good analysis. Be specific about:
- What you call this system
- What its primary purpose is
- Why this particular system matters to analyze

### Quick Guide to Optional Fields

**Time Unit**: The temporal resolution for your analysis (seconds, days, years). Choose what makes sense for your system's dynamics.

**Complexity**: System behavior type - Simple (predictable), Adaptive (responds to environment), or Evolveable (can fundamentally change structure).

**Equivalence**: Component type classification - what kind of thing this is based on its essential function (e.g., "Ribosome" in a cell, "Sales Team" in a company).

> ðŸ”‘ **Why this matters**: Clearly defining what your system is and what it does shapes everything that follows. A vague system definition leads to a vague analysis. A precise definition enables deep understanding.
