## Advanced Features

This section covers BERT's more sophisticated capabilities that allow for deeper system analysis and modeling of complex systems.

### System Decomposition

Decomposition is a powerful technique for breaking down complex systems into manageable parts:

* When and how to decompose systems
* Creating nested structures
* Maintaining coherence across levels
* Decomposition patterns and anti-patterns

### Multi-level Modeling

BERT allows you to model systems at multiple levels of abstraction:

* Working with multiple nesting levels
* Interface alignment across levels
* Ensuring consistency in decomposition
* Top-down vs. bottom-up approaches
