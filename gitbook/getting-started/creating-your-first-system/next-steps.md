# Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created your first system in BERT. From here, you can:

* Learn how to decompose your system into subsystems
* Add more detailed flows between elements
* Explore the element properties in depth

### System Hierarchy

BERT allows systems to be decomposed into multiple levels:

1. **Level 0**: The overall system and its environment
2. **Level 1**: Main subsystems and their connections
3. **Level 2+**: Further decomposition of subsystems

This hierarchical approach allows you to:

* Zoom in to see details when needed
* Zoom out to understand the big picture
* Manage complexity at each level appropriately

### Applying These Concepts

When modeling a system in BERT:

1. **Start with boundaries**: Define your system of interest
2. **Identify external entities**: What interacts with your system?
3. **Define interfaces**: Where do these interactions occur?
4. **Map flows**: What moves between elements?
5. **Decompose into subsystems**: Break down complex components
