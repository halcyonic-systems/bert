# Examples

## Quick Start with Model Browser

BERT includes a Model Browser with three ready-to-explore examples. Click the Model Browser button in the top toolbar to load any of these models instantly:

### üß¨ [A Cell](a-cell.md)
Explore how biological systems transform inputs into outputs through specialized interfaces. This model demonstrates cellular respiration with glucose/oxygen inputs and ATP/CO2 outputs.

### üè¢ [An Organization](an-organization.md)  
See how business systems decompose into functional departments. This model shows HR, Finance, and Sales as subsystems with their own inputs, outputs, and processes.

### ‚ö° [A Solar Panel](a-solar-panel.md)
Understand energy transformation systems. This model illustrates how solar radiation becomes electricity, with waste heat as a byproduct.

## Learning from Examples

Each example model teaches different BERT concepts:

1. **System Boundaries** - How to define what's inside vs. outside your system
2. **Input/Output Flows** - Modeling resource transformation and waste products  
3. **Interfaces** - Specific mechanisms that enable flows across boundaries
4. **Subsystems** - Hierarchical decomposition of complex systems
5. **Complexity Types** - When systems are adaptable vs. evolveable

## Basic Tutorials

After exploring the example models, follow these tutorials to create your own:

### [Creating Your First System](../creating-your-first-system/)

A complete walkthrough of starting a new project in BERT:
* Starting a new project
* Setting up the main system boundary
* Defining the system of interest
* Saving and reopening projects

### Building System Structure

Learn how to create and organize system elements:
* Adding external entities
* Creating interfaces
* Establishing subsystems
* Organizing layout for clarity

### Defining Flows

Connect elements with flows to represent system interactions:
* Connecting elements with flows
* Setting flow properties
* Flow types and distinctions
* Visualizing system dynamics

## Next Steps

1. **Load an Example** - Use the Model Browser to explore a pre-built model
2. **Modify It** - Try changing flow rates, adding new interfaces, or creating subsystems
3. **Build Your Own** - Apply the patterns to model a system from your domain
4. **Share Your Work** - Export your model as JSON to collaborate with others
