# An Organization

This example demonstrates how BERT can model a business organization as a complex adaptive system with departments, workflows, and external interactions.

## Overview

The organization model showcases:
- **System structure**: A company with HR, Finance, and Sales departments
- **Input flows**: Job applications, investments, and customer leads
- **Output flows**: Employees, financial reports, and revenue
- **Interfaces**: Department-specific processes and protocols

## Key System Components

### 1. System Definition
- **Name**: Organization
- **Complexity**: Adaptable and Evolveable (can reorganize and grow)
- **Environment**: Market (competitive business environment)

### 2. Subsystem Architecture

The organization contains three key departments modeled as subsystems:

#### HR Department
- **Inputs**: Job Applications
- **Outputs**: Hired Employees
- **Interface**: Recruitment Process
- **Function**: Transform candidates into productive employees

#### Finance Department  
- **Inputs**: Investment Capital
- **Outputs**: Financial Reports
- **Interface**: Accounting System
- **Function**: Manage financial resources and reporting

#### Sales Department
- **Inputs**: Customer Leads
- **Outputs**: Revenue
- **Interface**: Sales Process
- **Function**: Convert prospects into paying customers

### 3. System Boundaries
- **Internal**: Department boundaries are semi-permeable (0.5 porosity)
- **External**: Organization boundary is more controlled (0.3 porosity)
- **Information flows**: Cross-department communication channels

## Learning Points

This model illustrates several key organizational concepts:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Organizations naturally decompose into functional departments
2. **Specialization**: Each subsystem has specific inputs, outputs, and processes
3. **Interdependence**: Departments must coordinate to achieve organizational goals
4. **Adaptation**: The system can reorganize based on market conditions

## Try It Yourself

1. Load this model in BERT using the Model Browser
2. Explore how departments connect and interact
3. Try adding a new department (e.g., R&D or Marketing)
4. Model information flows between departments

## Extensions

Consider extending this model by:
- Adding feedback loops (customer satisfaction â†’ sales performance)
- Including resource constraints (budget limits, headcount)
- Modeling competitive dynamics with other organizations
- Adding temporal aspects (quarterly cycles, growth phases)

## Real-World Applications

This organizational model can be adapted for:
- **Startup planning**: Design organizational structure before hiring
- **Business analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- **Merger planning**: Visualize combined organizational structures
- **Process optimization**: Map and improve workflow between departments
