# Why BERT?

## **Why BERT Exists** <a href="#why-bert-exists" id="why-bert-exists"></a>

Modern systems are increasingly complex, interconnected, and difficult to understand through conventional analysis methods. Abstract modeling approaches often lose critical details and meanings that are essential for deep systems understanding.BERT was created to address these challenges by implementing a rigorous methodology called Deep Systems Analysis (DSA). Through DSA, BERT helps you:

* Systematically decompose complex systems into manageable components
* Preserve critical flows, interfaces, and relationships between components
* Capture knowledge in a standardized, computable format
* Build hierarchical models with unlimited decomposition levels

Unlike traditional diagramming or modeling tools, BERT enforces methodological rigor based on systems science principles, helping you capture not just the components of a system, but the crucial flows, interfaces, and relationships that define its behavior. detailed understanding of complex systems while preserving the crucial details and relationships that are often lost through traditional modeling approaches.

## BERT is For

* **Systems Analysts** who need to understand and document complex systems
* **Researchers** studying system dynamics and relationships
* **Engineers** designing robust, resilient systems
* **Decision Makers** seeking to understand system impacts and dependencies
* **Educators** teaching systems thinking and analysis methods

Whether you're mapping organizational processes, analyzing technology ecosystems, or researching complex social systems, BERT provides the structured approach needed to develop genuine systems understanding.
