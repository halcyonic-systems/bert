# BERT v0.2.0 Release Strategy

**Focus**: Ship a clean Structural Systems Analysis Tool without simulation complexity

## Quick Wins for 0.2.0 (1-2 Sessions)

### 1. Minimal Field Reorganization

#### System Panel Changes
- **Add**: Time Unit field (above Complexity)
- **Keep**: Name, Description, Time Unit, Complexity, Equivalence  
- **Hide**: Transformation, History (defer to v0.3.0)

#### Flow Panel Changes
- **Reorder**: Interaction Type → Substance Type → Interaction Usability
- **Hide**: Substance Sub Type, Parameters section (too dynamic for now)
- **Focus**: Keep it simple for structural analysis

### 2. Add Context Help Icons (?̅)

Quick implementation pattern:
```rust
// Simple tooltip component to add next to field labels
<span class="inline-flex items-center ml-1">
    <span class="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-600 cursor-help" 
          title="Time scale for system dynamics (e.g., seconds, years)">
        ?̅
    </span>
</span>
```

Priority fields needing context help:
- Time Unit: "Time scale for system dynamics"
- Complexity: "System behavior type (Simple/Adaptive/Evolveable)"
- Equivalence: "Grouping for similar systems"
- Interaction Type: "How components exchange resources"
- Substance Type: "What flows between components"

### 3. Clear Mode Labeling

Add badge/label: **"Structural Analysis Mode"**
- Sets clear expectation: this version is about structure, not simulation
- Hints at future capabilities without over-promising
- Reduces confusion about dynamic features

### 4. Simplify Confusing Labels

Quick renames for clarity:
- "Interaction Usability" → "Usage Type"
- "Substance Amount" → Hide for now (or "Relative Amount")  
- Parameters "Value" → "Initial Value" (if kept)

## Deferred to Post-0.2.0

- Full static/dynamic mode separation (needs design study)
- Transformation functions and history (require temporal context)
- Advanced flow parameters (simulation-focused)
- Comprehensive help system (iterate based on user feedback)
- Substance Sub Type and Unit fields (too granular initially)

## Release Messaging

### BERT 0.2.0: "Structural Systems Analysis Tool"
- **Tagline**: "Model system structure and relationships with clarity"
- **Features**: Spatial interaction, Model Browser, clean UI
- **Promise**: "Dynamic simulation features coming in v0.3.0"
- **Goal**: Gather user feedback on core UX patterns

### BERT 0.3.0: "Dynamic Modeling Introduction" (Future)
- Add temporal features based on user research
- Implement clear static/dynamic mode separation
- Progressive disclosure of simulation complexity

## Implementation Priority

1. **Session 1**: Field reorganization + label simplification
2. **Session 2**: Context help icons + mode labeling
3. **Testing**: Ensure spatial interaction remains stable
4. **Release**: Ship with clear structural analysis focus

## Success Criteria

- Users understand they're doing structural analysis
- No confusion about missing simulation features
- Clean, approachable UI for system modeling
- Clear upgrade path to dynamic features

## Key Principle

**Don't try to be both things at once**. Ship an excellent structural analysis tool now, evolve to simulation later based on user needs and feedback.
