# BERT (Bounded Entity Reasoning Toolkit)
A software tool that guides users through the rigorous analysis of complex adaptive systems

# Quick Start
Download [BERT v.0.1.0 here](https://github.com/halcyonic-systems/bert/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (macOS only, PC version coming soon)
View [our tutorial videos](https://github.com/halcyonic-systems/bert/blob/main/docs/Tutorials.md) introducing BERT's basic functionality. 

# Key Features
- Guides the systematic decomposition of complex systems by enforcing Deep Systems Analysis methodology 
- Visual system mapping that preserves critical flows, interfaces, and relationships between components
- Structured knowledge capture in a standardized, computable format enabling validation and sharing

# Example Analyses
- The Bitcoin Network

# Why BERT?
BERT enables analysts to develop detailed understanding of complex systems while preserving the crucial details and meanings often lost through abstract modeling approaches. The tool implements a rigorous methodology called Deep Systems Analysis (DSA).

# Technical Background
BERT implements ideas from [George Mobus's](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus) [Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling and Design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-93482-8). After an interdisciplinary career spanning naval engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, energy systems modeling, and systems science, Mobus identified key limitations in standard systems modeling frameworks like [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-online.aspx) and [UML](https://www.uml.org/)/[SysML](https://sysml.org/). To address these gaps, he proposed the creation of a new formal "System Language" (SL) grounded in systems science principles.

BERT represents a first step toward developing this formal systems language, built specifically for modern systems scientists.
