# BERT (Bounded Entity Reasoning Toolkit)


BERT is a software tool for decomposing complex adaptive systems with deep systems analysis (DSA). It enables analysts to develop detailed understanding of complex systems while preserving the crucial details and meanings often lost through abstract modeling approaches.


# Background
BERT implements ideas from [George Mobus's](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus) [Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling and Design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-93482-8). After an interdisciplinary career spanning naval engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, energy systems modeling, and systems science, Mobus identified key limitations in standard systems modeling frameworks like [Stella](https://www.iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-online.aspx) and [UML](https://www.uml.org/)/[SysML](https://sysml.org/). To address these gaps, he proposed the creation of a new formal "System Language" (SL) grounded in systems science principles.

BERT represents a first step toward developing this formal systems language, built specifically for modern systems scientists.
