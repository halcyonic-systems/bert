## What is BERT?

BERT brings scientific rigor to systems analysis through a formal implementation of systems theory. Built on the System Language (SL) framework, it provides researchers and practitioners with a structured methodology for:

- **Formalizing system boundaries** with mathematical precision
- **Characterizing flows** through rigorous entity relationship mapping
- **Modeling complex relationships** using systems science principles
- **Documenting system interactions** with consistent scientific notation

BERT transforms abstract systems concepts into concrete, analyzable models that bridge theoretical systems science with practical applications.

## üìñ Scientific Background

BERT implements the System Language (SL) framework for bounded entity reasoning, a formalized approach to systems analysis. It provides a rigorous methodology for modeling complex adaptive systems through precisely defined boundaries, flows, and relationships.

The software bridges theoretical systems science with visualization technology, enabling researchers to apply systems theory principles to real-world complexity with mathematical precision. This approach allows for:

- Consistent application of systems theory across domains
- Standardized notation for system elements and relationships
- Precise documentation of system boundaries and interfaces
- Integration of qualitative and quantitative systems approaches

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Web Version

The easiest way to use BERT is through our web application:

1. Visit [https://bert.systems](https://bert.systems)
2. No installation required - works in your browser
3. Your data remains local to your device

### Desktop Applications

For the full scientific toolkit, download the desktop application:

#### Windows
- Download the latest `.exe` installer from [Releases](https://github.com/halcyonic-systems/bert/releases)
- Run the installer and follow on-screen instructions

#### macOS
