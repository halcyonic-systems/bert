# BERT Utility Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for development, building, and maintenance of the BERT project.

## Available Scripts

Currently, this directory is reserved for future utility scripts that will help with:

- Build automation
- Development environment setup
- Testing and validation
- Documentation generation
- Release preparation

## Adding Scripts

When adding scripts to this directory:

1. Use clear, descriptive names
2. Add proper documentation and usage instructions
3. Ensure scripts are platform-agnostic when possible
4. Include error handling

## Script Organization

Organize scripts into subdirectories based on their purpose:

- `build/` - Build-related scripts
- `dev/` - Development environment scripts
- `test/` - Testing automation scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation generation scripts

## Running Scripts

For consistency, all scripts should be runnable from the repository root:

```bash
# Example (future usage)
./scripts/build/release.sh
```
