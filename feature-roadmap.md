# BERT Feature Roadmap

This document outlines potential features for the BERT system modeling tool, prioritized to support systems science research and documentation needs.

## High Priority

1. **Create controls/shortcuts help panel**
   - Modal dialog showing all keyboard shortcuts and mouse controls
   - Improve user onboarding and discoverability of existing functionality
   - Make advanced features more accessible to new users

2. **Add UI toggle button for black-white theme** ✅ COMPLETED
   - ✅ Keyboard shortcut implemented: Ctrl+Alt+B toggles between normal and white background
   - Simple button to switch between normal and B&W modes
   - Complement the existing Ctrl+Alt+B keyboard shortcut
   - Support creation of professional diagrams for academic papers and presentations

3. **Add system template library**
   - Pre-configured system patterns for common research models
   - Include templates for cybernetic systems, feedback loops, hierarchical structures
   - Accelerate creation of standard system types for research

4. **Create automated documentation generator**
   - Export system models to GitBook-compatible markdown
   - Automate the process of documenting complex systems
   - Generate consistent documentation for research publications

## Medium Priority

5. **Implement save confirmation dialog**
   - Prompt user when closing with unsaved changes
   - Prevent accidental loss of research models
   - Improve overall user experience and data safety

6. **Create element search functionality**
   - Quick find and focus specific elements by name
   - Navigate and modify complex system models efficiently
   - Support working with large-scale system diagrams

7. **Implement export to PNG/SVG functionality**
   - Export visualizations for documentation and presentations
   - Support high-quality vector graphics for research papers
   - Enable sharing of diagrams with non-BERT users

8. **Add element grouping capability**
   - Select and manipulate multiple elements as a group
   - Organize complex systems into logical subsections
   - Improve workflow when working with related components

9. **Add system metrics dashboard**
   - Calculate and display complexity metrics for analysis
   - Support quantitative evaluation of system properties
   - Enable comparative analysis between different system models

10. **Implement cross-references between models**
    - Link related systems across different diagrams
    - Create networks of interconnected system models
    - Support building comprehensive system-of-systems frameworks
