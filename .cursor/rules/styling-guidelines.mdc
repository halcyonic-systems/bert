# Rust Nightly Style Guide

## Overview

This style guide establishes coding standards for the BERT project, leveraging Rust nightly features while maintaining code quality and consistency. All contributions should adhere to these guidelines to ensure code readability, maintainability, and reliability.

## Core Principles

1. **Safety First**: Unsafe code should be rigorously justified and documented
2. **Readability Over Brevity**: Prefer clear code over terse code
3. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns within the codebase
4. **Documentation**: All public items require documentation
5. **Performance Awareness**: Optimize for readability first, then performance where necessary

## Rust Edition and Toolchain

```toml
# In rust-toolchain.toml
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly"
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]
```

- Use **Rust Nightly** channel for development
- Keep `rust-toolchain.toml` updated with specific nightly version
- All code must pass `cargo +nightly fmt` and `cargo +nightly clippy`

## Code Organization

### File Structure

- One primary module per file
- Group related types, traits, and functions in the same module
- Use the module system to create a logical hierarchy
- Limit file size to 500-1000 lines; split larger files

### Module Organization

```rust
// 1. Feature flags
#![feature(string_remove_matches)]

// 2. External crate imports (alphabetized)
use bevy::prelude::*;
use leptos::prelude::*;

// 3. Standard library imports (alphabetized)
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Arc;

// 4. Internal crate imports (alphabetized)
use crate::bevy_app::components::*;
use crate::leptos_app::components::*;

// 5. Constants
const MAX_ZOOM_LEVEL: f32 = 5.0;

// 6. Type definitions
type EntityMap = HashMap<Entity, ComponentData>;

// 7. Module declarations
mod submodule;

// 8. Code
```

## Naming Conventions

### General Rules

- Use **snake_case** for variables, functions, modules, and fields
- Use **CamelCase** for types, traits, and enum variants
- Use **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** for constants and static variables
- Use **`'static`** lifetime when applicable instead of explicit lifetimes
- Prefer descriptive names over abbreviations

### Bevy-Specific Naming

- Systems: verb_noun format (e.g., `update_flow_curve`, `spawn_interface`)
- Components: noun or adjective (e.g., `FlowCurve`, `SelectedHighlightHelperAdded`)
- Resources: noun (e.g., `Zoom`, `FixedSystemElementGeometriesByNestingLevel`)
- Events: noun or past participle (e.g., `RemoveEvent`, `ExternalEntityDrag`)

### Function Names

- Use action verbs for functions that perform actions
- Use `get_` prefix only for functions that retrieve data with computation
- Use `is_`, `has_`, `should_` prefixes for boolean-returning functions
- Use `try_` prefix for functions that can fail and return a Result

## Types and Type Safety

### Type Definitions

- Use Rust's type system to prevent logic errors
- Define new types rather than relying on primitive types
- Use `struct` for data with multiple fields
- Use tuple structs for simple wrappers (`struct NestingLevel(u16)`)
- Use newtypes to provide type safety for primitive types

### Generics and Traits

- Use generics to create flexible, reusable components
- Prefer trait bounds over concrete types where appropriate
- Implement `Debug` for all types
- Implement `Clone`, `Copy`, `PartialEq`, etc. only when semantically appropriate

### Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for operations that can fail
- Define custom error types for complex modules
- Use `?` operator for error propagation
- Avoid `unwrap()` and `expect()` in production code (except in tests)
- Document all potential error scenarios

## Formatting and Layout

### Whitespace

- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code
- Limit line length to 100 characters
- Use single blank line between top-level items

### Expressions and Statements

- Break long chains with one method per line, indented
- Break long function declarations after the opening parenthesis
- Place the opening brace on the same line for control flow statements
- Prefer expression-oriented code (avoid unnecessary `return` statements)

### Comments

- Use `///` for documentation comments
- Use `//` for implementation comments
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Comment complex algorithms and non-obvious logic
- Reference systems science concepts in comments where applicable

## Nightly Features Usage

### Allowed Features

- **Generic Associated Types (GATs)**: `#![feature(generic_associated_types)]`
- **String Manipulation**: `#![feature(string_remove_matches)]`
- **Advanced Pattern Matching**: `#![feature(exclusive_range_pattern)]`
- **Const Generics**: `#![feature(adt_const_params)]`
- **Async Features**: `#![feature(async_closure)]`

### Feature Usage Guidelines

- Document all nightly feature usage with comments explaining necessity
- Isolate nightly features in dedicated modules when possible
- Consider stable alternatives before using nightly features
- Create abstraction layers around nightly features for easier future migration

## Entity Component System (ECS) Patterns

### Components

- Keep components small and focused
- Store minimal data in components
- Use marker components for state (zero-size types)
- Implement `Component` derive macro for all components

```rust
#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FlowCurve {
    pub start_point: Vec3,
    pub end_point: Vec3,
    pub start_direction: Vec3,
    pub end_direction: Vec3,
}

#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct HasFlowInterfaceButton {
    pub button_entity: Entity,
}

// Marker component (zero-sized)
#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub struct HasFlowOtherEndButton;
```

### Systems

- Keep systems small and focused on one task
- Use system sets to organize related systems
- Consider system ordering and dependencies
- Document complex system interactions

```rust
// Simple system with clear responsibility
pub fn update_flow_curve(
    mut query: Query<(&mut FlowCurve, &Transform)>,
) {
    for (mut curve, transform) in query.iter_mut() {
        // Update curve based on transform
    }
}

// System using multiple queries
pub fn update_interface_positions_from_system_radius(
    system_query: Query<(&Transform, &crate::bevy_app::components::System)>,
    interface_query: Query<&Interface>,
    mut transform_query: Query<&mut Transform, With<Interface>>,
) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Resources

- Use resources for shared global state
- Prefer small, focused resources over large, complex ones
- Initialize resources in app setup

```rust
#[derive(Resource, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct Zoom(pub f32);

impl Default for Zoom {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self(1.0)
    }
}
```

## Bevy-Specific Guidelines

### Plugin Organization

- Create plugins for discrete functionality
- Implement the `Plugin` trait for all plugins
- Register systems, resources, events in the plugin's `build` method
- Document plugin dependencies and behavior

```rust
pub struct MouseInteractionPlugin;

impl Plugin for MouseInteractionPlugin {
    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
        app.add_systems(Update, (
                handle_mouse_movement,
                handle_selection,
            ))
            .add_event::<SelectionEvent>();
    }
}
```

### Query Optimization

- Be mindful of query complexity
- Use component storage access patterns for optimal performance
- Limit the use of `World` direct access
- Prefer statically dispatched systems over dynamically dispatched ones

### Event Usage

- Use events for cross-system communication
- Keep event data minimal
- Handle events in dedicated systems
- Document event producers and consumers

```rust
#[derive(Event, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FlowCreatedEvent {
    pub flow_entity: Entity,
    pub source_entity: Entity,
    pub target_entity: Entity,
}
```

## Leptos-Specific Guidelines

### Component Organization

- Keep components small and focused
- Use signal patterns consistently
- Separate state from rendering logic
- Use Leptos reactive primitives appropriately

```rust
#[component]
pub fn SettingsModal(
    is_open: Signal<bool>,
    on_close: Callback<()>,
) -> impl IntoView {
    let (active_tab, set_active_tab) = create_signal("general");
    
    view! {
        <Show when=move || is_open.get()>
            <div class="modal-overlay">
                <div class="modal-content">
                    <h2>"Settings"</h2>
                    <TabNavigation 
                        active_tab=active_tab
                        set_active_tab=set_active_tab
                    />
                    <TabContent active_tab=active_tab />
                    <div class="modal-actions">
                        <button on:click=move |_| on_close.call(())>
                            "Close"
                        </button>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </Show>
    }
}
```

### Reactivity Patterns

- Use `create_signal` for local component state
- Use `create_resource` for async data fetching
- Use `create_memo` for derived values
- Use `create_effect` for side effects
- Minimize direct DOM manipulation

## Performance Considerations

### General Guidelines

- Profile before optimizing
- Comment performance-critical code
- Benchmark changes to verify improvements
- Document performance assumptions

### Memory Management

- Be aware of allocation patterns
- Reuse allocations where possible
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider using arena allocators for ECS-related data

### Parallelism

- Use Bevy's parallel execution capabilities
- Be aware of system dependencies and execution order
- Use system sets to control parallel execution
- Avoid shared mutable state between parallel systems

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test small units of functionality
- Use the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute for test modules
- Name test functions descriptively
- Use proper assertions

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_flow_curve_computation() {
        let start_point = Vec3::new(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
        let end_point = Vec3::new(10.0, 10.0, 0.0);
        let curve = compute_flow_curve(start_point, end_point);
        
        assert!(curve.length() > 0.0);
        assert_eq!(curve.start_point, start_point);
        assert_eq!(curve.end_point, end_point);
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components
- Set up minimal test environments
- Use Bevy's test utilities
- Document test assumptions and limitations

## Documentation Guidelines

### General Rules

- Document all public items
- Include examples where appropriate
- Document unsafe code extensively
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### Function Documentation

```rust
/// Updates the geometry of a flow curve based on its start and end points.
///
/// This function computes the cubic Bézier curve control points that create
/// a visually pleasing flow representation between two system entities.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `flow_curve` - The flow curve component to update
/// * `start_transform` - The transform of the starting entity
/// * `end_transform` - The transform of the ending entity
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Updated flow curve with computed control points.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Will panic if the distance between start and end points is zero.
pub fn update_flow_curve_geometry(
    mut flow_curve: FlowCurve,
    start_transform: &Transform,
    end_transform: &Transform,
) -> FlowCurve {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Type Documentation

```rust
/// Represents the visual curve of a flow between system entities.
///
/// Flow curves are implemented as cubic Bézier curves with automatically
/// computed control points based on the positions and orientations of
/// the connected entities.
///
/// # Systems Science Context
///
/// In systems theory, flows represent the transfer of material, energy,
/// or information between system entities. The visual representation uses
/// curves to clearly indicate direction and connection points.
#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct FlowCurve {
    /// Starting point of the curve in world space
    pub start_point: Vec3,
    
    /// Ending point of the curve in world space
    pub end_point: Vec3,
    
    /// Direction vector from start point (normalized)
    pub start_direction: Vec3,
    
    /// Direction vector to end point (normalized)
    pub end_direction: Vec3,
}
```

## Version Control Guidelines

### Commit Messages

- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Begin with a capitalized action verb
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Provide detailed description in the commit body
- Reference related issues or tickets

```

```

### Branch Naming

- Use descriptive branch names with prefixes
- Format: `<type>/<description>`
- Types: `feature`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Use kebab-case for description

```
feature/settings-implementation
fix/flow-curve-rendering
docs/architecture-overview
refactor/component-organization
```
