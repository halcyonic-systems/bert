# LLM Implementation Workflow

This document defines the structured workflow for implementing features with LLM assistance in the BERT project.

## Phase 1: Documentation & Planning

### 1.1 Feature Documentation Setup
- [ ] Generate feature documentation template
  ```bash
  ./scripts/bert.sh feature "Feature Name"
  ```
- [ ] Fill in initial sections (Overview, Goals, Requirements)
- [ ] Document path: `docs/features/feature-name.md`
- [ ] Add to git tracking

### 1.2 Codebase Analysis
- [ ] Search for similar existing patterns in the codebase
- [ ] Identify reusable components and established conventions
- [ ] Review existing styling and interaction patterns
- [ ] Check version compatibility for dependencies (Leptos, Bevy, Tauri)
- [ ] Document findings in feature documentation

### 1.3 Implementation Planning
- [ ] List all files requiring modification or creation
- [ ] Identify integration points with existing systems
- [ ] Propose specific technical approach
- [ ] Estimate complexity and potential challenges
- [ ] Document implementation plan in feature documentation

### 1.3 User Confirmation
- [ ] Present discovery findings to user
- [ ] Confirm implementation approach
- [ ] Get approval before proceeding to implementation

## Phase 2: Incremental Implementation

### 2.1 File-by-File Implementation
- [ ] Create/modify one file at a time
- [ ] Follow established patterns from `patterns.mdc`
- [ ] Test compilation after each significant change
- [ ] Fix errors immediately before proceeding

### 2.2 Component Creation Pattern
1. **Create component file** in appropriate directory
2. **Add module export** to `mod.rs`
3. **Test compilation** to verify module structure
4. **Implement component logic** following established patterns
5. **Test compilation** again

### 2.3 Integration Pattern
1. **Import component** in main app file
2. **Add signal management** for component state
3. **Integrate component** into existing UI structure
4. **Test functionality** at each step
5. **Validate user workflow** end-to-end

### 2.4 Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update feature documentation as implementation progresses
- [ ] Record API changes and design decisions
- [ ] Document any deviations from original plan
- [ ] Add code examples to documentation

### 2.5 Error Resolution
- **Immediate fixing**: Address compilation errors before continuing
- **Pattern checking**: Verify against known working patterns
- **API verification**: Check version-specific API usage
- **Documentation review**: Consult relevant documentation when stuck

## Phase 3: Integration & Polish

### 3.1 Styling Consistency
- [ ] Apply consistent Tailwind classes following project conventions
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works across screen sizes
- [ ] Verify color scheme matches existing components
- [ ] Test interactive states (hover, focus, active)

### 3.2 Documentation
- [ ] Add component documentation following `commenting-guidelines.mdc`
- [ ] Include usage examples where appropriate
- [ ] Document any new patterns or conventions
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if needed

### 3.3 Complete Testing
- [ ] Test complete user workflow manually
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Check console for errors or warnings
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

### 3.4 Documentation Finalization
- [ ] Complete all sections of feature documentation
- [ ] Add final implementation details and examples
- [ ] Ensure documentation is consistent with implementation
- [ ] Review documentation for clarity and completeness

### 3.5 Commit Preparation
- [ ] Review all changes against original requirements
- [ ] Prepare clear commit message referencing feature documentation
- [ ] Ensure all files are properly formatted
- [ ] Double-check no temporary or debug code remains
- [ ] Verify feature documentation is complete and committed

## Quality Gates

### Before Moving to Next Phase
- **Phase 1 → 2**: Feature documentation initiated and implementation plan documented
- **Phase 2 → 3**: All files compile without errors and implementation details documented
- **Phase 3 → Complete**: Full functionality verified and documentation completed

### Rollback Triggers
- **Compilation errors** that can't be resolved within 3 attempts
- **Fundamental architecture conflicts** discovered during implementation
- **User requests** to change approach mid-implementation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Planning Phase
- ❌ Skipping feature documentation generation
- ❌ Starting implementation without user confirmation
- ❌ Not checking existing patterns first
- ❌ Underestimating integration complexity
- ❌ Not documenting implementation plan

### Implementation Phase
- ❌ Making multiple changes before testing compilation
- ❌ Ignoring established patterns and conventions
- ❌ Proceeding with errors unresolved
- ❌ Not updating documentation as implementation progresses
- ❌ Failing to document design decisions and API changes

### Integration Phase
- ❌ Skipping manual testing of complete workflow
- ❌ Not checking for regressions in existing features
- ❌ Forgetting to finalize feature documentation
- ❌ Submitting incomplete documentation
- ❌ Not referencing documentation in commit messages

## Success Indicators

### High-Quality Implementation
- ✅ Follows all established patterns and conventions
- ✅ Compiles without errors or warnings
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing functionality
- ✅ Provides clear value to users
- ✅ Is well-documented and maintainable
- ✅ Has complete feature documentation in docs/features/

### Efficient Process
- ✅ Minimal back-and-forth with user during implementation
- ✅ No major rework required after initial implementation
- ✅ Clear, focused commits with good messages
- ✅ Reusable patterns identified and documented

## Workflow Customization

### For Simple Features (< 2 hours)
- Combine Phase 1 and 2 for efficiency
- Focus on pattern reuse over custom solutions
- Minimal documentation beyond code comments

### For Complex Features (> 4 hours)
- Add intermediate checkpoints within each phase
- Create detailed implementation plan document
- Consider breaking into multiple smaller features

### For Experimental Features
- Add explicit experimentation phase before Phase 1
- Include rollback plan in initial planning
- Document lessons learned for future reference
