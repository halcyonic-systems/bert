### Settings Implementation

**Category**: UI/Infrastructure

**Priority**: High

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours

**Target Release**: v0.2

#### Description

A comprehensive settings system that allows users to customize their BERT experience, including theme preferences, interface options, and performance settings. The implementation follows a modal-based approach to minimize impact on the existing architecture while providing a clean, intuitive interface.

#### User Stories

- As a user, I want to customize the application theme, so that I can create better screenshots and reduce eye strain
- As a user, I want to adjust interface preferences, so that I can optimize my workflow
- As a user, I want to modify performance settings, so that I can run BERT efficiently on my hardware
- As a user, I want my settings to persist between sessions, so that I don't need to reconfigure every time

#### Success Criteria

- [ ] User can open settings with `Ctrl+,` or button click
- [ ] Black & white theme available for screenshots
- [ ] Settings persist across app restarts
- [ ] No impact on existing functionality
- [ ] Clean, intuitive user interface
