# User Story: Professional Controls for Systems Analysis and Modeling

## The Problem

**BERT's current control scheme creates friction for systems scientists and analysts who expect professional-grade modeling tool standards.**

### Current User Experience
1. Systems scientist opens BERT for complex system modeling
2. Attempts to zoom using standard `Ctrl+Mouse Wheel` - doesn't work
3. Tries to pan with `Space+Drag` like in NetLogo or Stella - doesn't work
4. Makes modeling errors but can't undo (`Ctrl+Z`) - no undo system exists
5. Wants to copy system components - no copy/paste functionality
6. Struggles to discover keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflows
7. Feels tool lacks professional polish expected from serious modeling software

### Real User Feedback
- "The controls don't feel very intuitive"
- General sense that interaction patterns don't match expectations from other systems modeling tools

### Root Cause
BERT's control scheme deviates from both universal software standards (zoom, undo) and professional modeling tool conventions, creating unnecessary friction for domain experts who are comfortable with complex tools but expect standard interaction patterns.

## The Solution: Professional-Grade Control Standards

### User Story
> **As a systems scientist**, I want BERT's controls to meet professional modeling tool standards, so that I can focus on analysis rather than learning non-standard interaction patterns.

### Key Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Efficient Model Navigation
- Researcher working with complex multi-level system model
- Uses `Ctrl+Mouse Wheel` to zoom in/out smoothly
- Pans with `Space+Drag` when examining different regions
- Quickly navigates without thinking about tool mechanics
- **Result**: Fluid exploration of complex system hierarchies

#### Scenario 2: Iterative Model Development
- Systems analyst refining organizational model
- Makes structural changes to test hypotheses
- Uses `Ctrl+Z` to undo changes that don't work
- Compares different model versions through iteration
- **Result**: Confident experimentation with complex models

#### Scenario 3: Professional Workflow Integration
- Academic researcher preparing models for publication
- Uses `Ctrl+C/V` to duplicate system components
- Leverages `Ctrl+A` to select entire subsystems
- Applies `Ctrl+S` for reliable saving (already implemented)
- **Result**: Smooth integration with standard academic workflows

#### Scenario 4: Rapid Model Construction
- Consultant building client system models under time pressure
- Discovers shortcuts through tooltips and help system
- Uses keyboard shortcuts for efficient element creation
- Maintains modeling flow without interface friction
- **Result**: Professional efficiency matching other modeling tools

### Expected Professional Standards

#### Universal Software Standards
- **Zoom**: `Ctrl/Cmd + Mouse Wheel`, `Ctrl/Cmd +/-`
- **Pan**: `Space + Drag` (like Stella, NetLogo)
- **Undo/Redo**: `Ctrl/Cmd + Z/Y` (critical for modeling)
- **Copy/Paste**: `Ctrl/Cmd + C/V` (component replication)
- **Select All**: `Ctrl/Cmd + A` (system-wide selection)

#### Systems Modeling Tool Patterns
- **NetLogo**: Keyboard-centric with discoverable shortcuts
- **Stella**: Drag-and-drop with standard zoom/pan
- **Gephi**: Complex but consistent interaction patterns
- **MATLAB/Simulink**: Professional tooltips and help integration

#### Professional Polish Features
- **Tooltip Discovery**: Shortcuts visible on hover
- **Help Integration**: Accessible control reference
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear interaction states
- **Error Prevention**: Undo for safe experimentation

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in user complaints about control intuitiveness
- Faster onboarding for users familiar with other modeling tools
- Increased confidence in model iteration and experimentation
- Professional credibility matching other systems analysis tools

### Implementation Priority

#### Phase 1: Critical Standards (Immediate)
1. **Add Universal Zoom**: `Ctrl/Cmd + Mouse Wheel` and `Ctrl/Cmd +/-`
2. **Implement Undo/Redo**: Essential for professional modeling workflows
3. **Add Standard Panning**: `Space + Drag` as primary method
4. **Tooltip Integration**: Show shortcuts on hover for discoverability

#### Phase 2: Professional Features (Follow-up)
1. **Copy/Paste System**: `Ctrl/Cmd + C/V` for component duplication
2. **Select All**: `Ctrl/Cmd + A` for system-wide operations
3. **Enhanced Help**: Searchable shortcut reference
4. **Visual Polish**: Better feedback for interaction states

### Value Proposition
- **Professional credibility**: Meets standards expected by systems scientists
- **Reduced friction**: Focus on analysis, not learning tool quirks
- **Workflow integration**: Fits into existing academic/professional practices
- **Confidence building**: Reliable undo enables bold experimentation
- **Efficiency gains**: Standard shortcuts accelerate modeling workflows

## Impact on Adoption
- **Domain credibility**: Tool feels professional to systems modeling community
- **Reduced learning curve**: Familiar patterns from other modeling tools
- **Academic acceptance**: Meets standards for research and publication workflows
- **Professional use**: Suitable for consulting and enterprise modeling work
