# User Story: Convert BERT to Standalone Repository

## The Problem

**BERT being a fork rather than a standalone repository is creating professional workflow friction and limiting growth opportunities.**

### Current Pain Points

#### 1. Accidental Upstream Pull Requests
- GitHub's UI defaults to creating PRs against the original upstream repository
- Easy to accidentally submit BERT work to the wrong repo
- Requires constant vigilance when creating PRs
- Wastes time when mistakes need to be redirected

#### 2. Tool Integration Limitations
- Merit.systems (bounty platform) only connects to standalone repos
- Cannot leverage bounty system to incentivize contributions
- Limits ability to scale development beyond core team
- Blocks community contribution incentives

#### 3. Professional Presentation
- "Forked from X" badge provides no context about BERT's purpose
- Looks like a side experiment rather than a serious project
- Doesn't reflect BERT's evolution into its own distinct tool
- Undermines credibility with potential users and contributors

### Root Cause
BERT started as a fork when it was a hobby exploration, but has now evolved into its own distinct project with different goals, architecture, and direction. The fork relationship no longer serves any purpose but creates ongoing friction.

## The Solution: Standalone Repository

### User Story
> **As the systems architect for BERT**, I want BERT to be a standalone repository rather than a fork, so that I can use professional development tools, avoid workflow friction, and present BERT as the independent project it has become.

### Key Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Clean Pull Request Workflow
- Developer creates new feature branch
- Opens PR creation page
- GitHub defaults to BERT's own repository
- No risk of accidentally submitting to upstream
- **Result**: Smooth, error-free contribution workflow

#### Scenario 2: Bounty-Driven Development
- Identify high-value feature or bug fix
- Create bounty on Merit.systems
- Connect BERT repository directly
- Community developers claim and complete bounties
- **Result**: Scalable development beyond core team

#### Scenario 3: Professional First Impression
- New user discovers BERT
- Sees standalone repository with clear purpose
- No confusing "forked from" relationship
- Repository stands on its own merit
- **Result**: Clear project identity and credibility

### Success Metrics
- Zero accidental PRs to upstream repository
- Successful Merit.systems integration
- Increased contributor confidence
- Cleaner project presentation

### Implementation Approach
1. **Detach Fork Relationship**
   - Contact GitHub support to convert fork to standalone
   - Preserves all history, issues, and PRs
   - Removes fork relationship while keeping repository intact

2. **Alternative: Fresh Repository**
   - Create new standalone repository
   - Push all branches and tags
   - Migrate issues and discussions
   - Archive fork with redirect notice

### Value Proposition
- **Eliminates friction**: No more PR mistakes or tool limitations
- **Enables growth**: Bounty system can incentivize contributions
- **Professional identity**: BERT presented as independent project
- **Future flexibility**: No constraints from upstream relationship

## Impact on Adoption
- **Developer experience**: Smoother contribution workflow attracts developers
- **Scaling potential**: Bounty system enables faster feature development
- **Project credibility**: Standalone status reflects BERT's maturity
- **Tool ecosystem**: Can integrate with any tools requiring repo ownership
