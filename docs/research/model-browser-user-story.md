# Model Browser User Story

## The Problem

**New users can't immediately see BERT's value because there's no easy way to load example models.**

### Current User Experience
1. User opens BERT (desktop or web)
2. Sees empty interface with minimal context
3. Must press Ctrl+L to load a file
4. Has to find/create their own JSON model file
5. Many users give up before experiencing BERT's capabilities

### Pain Points
- **Empty first impression**: Blank interface doesn't showcase BERT's potential
- **File friction**: Users need existing JSON files to see anything interesting
- **Hidden examples**: Example models exist in `private-dev/build/` but aren't accessible to users
- **Learning curve**: No guided way to explore different model types
- **Demo barrier**: Hard to quickly show BERT's capabilities to stakeholders

## The Solution: Model Browser

### User Story
> **As a new BERT user**, I want to immediately see example models when I open the application, so that I can understand what BERT does and explore its capabilities without having to create or find model files first.

### Key Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: First-Time User
- Opens BERT for the first time
- Clicks "Browse Models" button
- Sees grid of example models with thumbnails and descriptions
- Clicks "Basic Circuit" example
- Instantly sees electrical system visualization
- **Result**: Immediate understanding of BERT's purpose

#### Scenario 2: Demo/Presentation
- Presenting BERT to stakeholders
- Opens model browser
- Quickly switches between different domain examples (electrical, biological, mechanical)
- Shows versatility across different system types
- **Result**: Compelling demonstration of BERT's capabilities

#### Scenario 3: Learning/Exploration
- User wants to learn system modeling
- Browses categorized examples
- Loads "Ecosystem" model to understand biological systems
- Loads "Network" model to see information flow
- **Result**: Educational progression through different model types

### Success Metrics
- **Engagement**: % of users who load at least one model in their first session
- **Retention**: Users who return after initial experience
- **Time-to-value**: Seconds from opening BERT to seeing their first model
- **Demonstration**: Ability to show BERT's value in < 30 seconds

### Value Proposition
- **Immediate gratification**: Users see value within seconds
- **Discoverability**: Built-in examples showcase different use cases
- **Educational**: Examples teach best practices for system modeling
- **Reduced friction**: No need to create files before experiencing BERT
- **Better demos**: Easy to show BERT's capabilities to others

## Impact on Adoption

### Current State
- Users abandon before seeing BERT's value
- Hard to demonstrate capabilities
- Steep learning curve for new users
- Limited organic growth due to poor first impressions

### Expected Outcome
- Higher user engagement and retention
- Easier product demonstrations
- More effective onboarding
- Better word-of-mouth growth
- Reduced support burden (fewer "how do I use this?" questions)

## Implementation Priority
**High Priority** - This addresses the fundamental barrier to user adoption. Without seeing models, users can't understand what BERT does or why it's valuable.
