# Feature: Model Browser

## Overview

**Feature Name**: Model Browser  
**Branch**: feature/model-browser  
**Status**: Completed  
**Contributors**: Joel Beicher,joelbeicher,Joseph Ensminger,Maccesch,Marc-Stefan Cassola,matthias,rsthornton,Shingai Thornton  
**Date**: 2025-07-21

## Description

The Model Browser provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and loading pre-built BERT models directly from the application. This feature makes it easier for new users to explore BERT's capabilities and for experienced users to quickly access common system templates.

## Implemented Functionality

- Modal dialog interface that matches existing UI patterns
- "Model Browser" button in main toolbar (visible in both tree states)
- Grid layout displaying 3 placeholder models
- Responsive design that works on desktop and web
- Clean close functionality with overlay click or X button
- Three working example models: Cell (biological), Organization (business), Solar Panel (technical)
- Direct model loading with proper file event integration
- Embedded model data for offline functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Components Added

- `src/leptos_app/components/model_browser.rs`: Modal component for browsing and selecting models

### Components Modified

- `src/leptos_app/components/mod.rs`: Added model_browser module export
- `src/leptos_app/mod.rs`: Added Model Browser button and state management

### Architecture Decisions

- Followed existing modal pattern from ControlsMenu component for consistency
- Used Leptos signals for state management (visibility toggle)
- Implemented as a separate component for modularity
- Temporarily disabled file loading to get UI working first (MVP approach)
- Prepared for future integration with include_str! for bundled models

## Usage Examples

1. Click the "Model Browser" button in the top toolbar
2. Browse available models in the modal dialog
3. Click on a model to load it (currently disabled)
4. Close the browser with the X button or by clicking outside

## Testing Strategy

- Manually tested UI in both desktop (Tauri) and web environments
- Verified button appears in both tree visible/hidden states
- Tested modal open/close functionality
- Confirmed responsive grid layout works at different screen sizes

## Future Improvements

- Implement actual model loading functionality
- Add real example models (cell, organization, circuit)
- Add search/filter capabilities for larger model libraries
- Include model previews or thumbnails
- Add categories for organizing models
- Support for user-created model libraries
- Integration with remote model repositories
