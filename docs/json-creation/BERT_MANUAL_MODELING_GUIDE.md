## üèóÔ∏è BERT MODELING PHILOSOPHY

### Core Design Principles

1. **Purpose-Driven Analysis**
   - Start by identifying system's primary output/product
   - Work backward from outputs to required inputs
   - Focus on system's reason for existence

2. **Interface-Centric Design**
   - Interfaces are fundamental system components, not just connection points
   - Define what can cross system boundaries
   - Protocols specify how boundary crossing occurs

3. **Hierarchical Organization**
   - Systems contain subsystems in recursive patterns
   - Each level has appropriate time constants and complexity
   - Maintain system-subsystem relationships explicitly

4. **Constraint-Based Modeling**
   - Subsystems MUST attach to existing interfaces
   - Cannot create "floating" components without connections
   - Enforces realistic system connectivity

## üîÑ SYSTEMATIC MODELING WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: System Foundation

#### 1.1 Initialize Base System
**Starting Point**: BERT creates minimal JSON with single system circle

**Human Actions**:
1. Click system circle to select
2. In Element Details panel, configure:
   - **Name**: Change from "System" to domain-specific name
   - **Description**: Add clear, educational description
   - **Complexity**: Set Adaptable/Evolveable as appropriate
   - **Time Constant**: Select appropriate temporal scale
   - **Equivalence**: Add cross-domain metaphor

**AI Assistance**:
- Suggest appropriate complexity settings based on system type
- Recommend relevant time units for domain
- Provide domain-specific descriptions and naming
- Generate cross-domain equivalence metaphors

#### 1.2 Configure System Boundary
**Purpose**: Define what separates system from environment

**Human Actions**:
1. **Click on the boundary ring** (the stroke/edge of the system circle) to open Boundary Details panel
   - Note: This is BERT's spatial interaction feature - boundary is a separate clickable region
   - The boundary ring visually highlights when hovered
2. In the Boundary Details panel, configure:
   - **Description**: Explain regulatory function (note: appears before Name in current UI)
   - **Name**: Descriptive boundary name (UI inconsistency - should appear first)
   - **Porosity**: Set 0-1 based on boundary permeability
   - **Perceptive Fuzziness**: Set 0-1 for boundary clarity

**Best Practices**:
- Most biological systems: moderate porosity (0.3-0.7)
- Technical systems: low porosity (0.0-0.2)
- Social systems: high fuzziness (0.4-0.8)

### Phase 2: Output Definition (Required First)

#### 2.1 Create Primary Output Flow
**CRITICAL**: BERT enforces outputs-before-inputs workflow

**Human Actions** (Must be done in sequence):
1. **Click green arrow button** on system boundary ‚Üí Creates flow (red arrow appears)
2. **Click the red flow arrow** ‚Üí Configure flow properties:
   - **Name**: Specific product/output name
   - **Description**: What this output represents and why important
   - **Interaction Usability**: "Product" (primary outputs)
   - **Substance Type**: Energy/Material/Message as appropriate
   - Note: Legacy fields (Substance Sub Type, Amount, Unit, Parameters) exist in JSON but not in simplified UI

3. **Click green rectangle button** ‚Üí Creates interface on boundary
4. **Click the interface rectangle** ‚Üí Configure interface:
   - **Name**: Specific interface name (not "Interface")
   - **Description**: How this interface regulates flow
   - **Protocol**: 5-step algorithmic process (see templates below)

5. **Click green sink button** ‚Üí Creates external sink
6. **Click the sink** ‚Üí Configure external entity:
   - **Name**: What receives this output
   - **Description**: Why this entity needs the output

**Save immediately** after completing each full chain!

#### 2.2 Create Additional Outputs
**Typical outputs to consider**:
- **Primary Products**: Main system output/value
- **Waste Products**: Byproducts requiring disposal
- **Information Signals**: Status/control information
- **Energy Dissipation**: Heat, noise, other energy losses

Repeat 2.1 sequence for each additional output.

### Phase 3: Input Definition

#### 3.1 Create Resource Inputs
**After outputs are defined**, create required inputs using same sequence as 2.1:

**Input Categories**:
- **Material Resources**: Raw materials, components
- **Energy Inputs**: Power, fuel, activation energy  
- **Information/Control**: Instructions, feedback, coordination
- **Environmental Conditions**: Temperature, pressure, pH

#### 3.2 Source Configuration
**Sources represent environmental suppliers**:
- **Name**: Specific source type
- **Description**: What this source provides and why available
- **Reliability**: Steady vs. intermittent supply
- **Capacity**: Limits or constraints on supply

### Phase 4: Internal Subsystem Creation

#### 4.1 Interface-Attached Subsystems
**BERT Constraint**: All subsystems must attach to existing interfaces

**Creation Process**:
1. **Click green circle button on interface** ‚Üí Spawns subsystem attached to that interface
2. **Configure subsystem properties** following Phase 1 patterns

**Subsystem Types**:
- **Input Processors**: Transform raw inputs for internal use
- **Core Processors**: Perform primary system transformations
- **Output Generators**: Package outputs for delivery
- **Control/Regulation**: Coordinate and optimize system function
- **Maintenance**: Repair, cleanup, resource recycling

#### 4.2 Hub-and-Spoke Patterns
**BERT enables elegant internal organization**:
- **Central Controller**: Core subsystem at center receiving from all others
- **Peripheral Processors**: Specialized subsystems at boundary interfaces
- **Internal Flows**: Connect peripheral processors through central hub
- **Hierarchical Control**: Central system coordinates peripheral functions

### Phase 5: Flow Network Completion

#### 5.1 Internal Flow Creation
**Connect subsystems systematically**:
1. **Material Flows**: Raw materials ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Products
2. **Energy Flows**: Power distribution and utilization
3. **Information Flows**: Control signals and status feedback
4. **Waste Flows**: Byproducts ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Disposal

#### 5.2 Flow Configuration Best Practices
**For each flow, specify**:
- **Clear naming**: What substance/signal flows
- **Directional clarity**: Source ‚Üí Sink relationships
- **Substance type**: Energy/Material/Message classification
- **Usability**: Resource/Product/Waste designation
- Note: Quantitative details (rates, amounts) can be included in descriptions but aren't separate fields in simplified UI

## üíæ FILE MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES

### Save Operation Guidelines

#### Critical Save Points
**Always save after**:
1. **Complete flow chain creation** (Flow ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí Sink/Source)
2. **Subsystem configuration completion**
3. **Major structural changes**
4. **Before closing BERT or switching models**

#### File Lock Management

- **Symptoms**: Ctrl+S stops working, changes lost, inconsistent state
- **Solution**: Only have BERT access the active model file

#### Persistence Verification
**After each save**:
1. **Check file timestamp** to verify save occurred
2. **Quick JSON validation** if editing capabilities available
3. **Visual verification** that changes persist after BERT restart
4. **Backup critical models** before major modifications

### Model Organization Strategies
