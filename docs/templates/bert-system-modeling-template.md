## üìã Pre-Modeling System Analysis

Before opening BERT, answer these questions to understand your system:

### 1. System Identification
- **What is the system?** [Name and basic description]
- **What is its primary purpose?** [Main function/transformation]
- **What domain does it belong to?** [Biological, technological, social, economic, etc.]
- **What scale/level are you modeling?** [Molecular, organism, organization, ecosystem, etc.]

### 2. System Boundaries
- **What belongs INSIDE the system?**
- **What is OUTSIDE in the environment?**
- **Is the boundary physical or conceptual?**
- **How porous/fuzzy is the boundary?**

### 3. Input-Output Analysis (BERT's Purpose-Driven Approach)
- **Primary Product**: What does the system produce? (Start here!)
- **Waste Outputs**: What byproducts/waste does it generate?
- **Resource Inputs**: What materials/energy does it need?
- **Control Inputs**: What information/signals regulate it?

### 4. Subsystem Decomposition
- **What are the major functional components?**
- **How do they relate to the interfaces?** (Input processors, output generators)
- **Is there a central coordinator/hub?**
- **What hierarchical levels exist?**

### 5. Flow Patterns
- **Material flows**: What physical substances move through the system?
- **Energy flows**: How does energy transform and dissipate?
- **Information flows**: What messages/signals coordinate activities?
- **Control flows**: What regulatory feedback exists?

## üé® Visual Design Guidelines

### Spatial Organization
- **Inputs**: Left side (resources) and top (control)
- **Outputs**: Right side (products) and bottom (waste)
- **Central elements**: System interior
- **Symmetry**: Balance visual weight when possible

### Color Conventions (BERT defaults)
- **Blue arrows**: Incoming flows (resources)
- **Red arrows**: Outgoing flows (products/waste)
- **Green UI elements**: Creation/addition buttons
- **Dark circles**: Systems and subsystems
- **Rectangles**: Interfaces on boundaries

### Labeling Best Practices
- **Be specific**: "ATP Synthase" not just "Energy Interface"
- **Use domain terminology**: Accurate to the field
- **Include function**: "Glucose Transporter (Input)"
- **Consistency**: Similar items use similar naming patterns

## ü§ù Human-LLM Collaboration Tips

### For Humans:
1. **Start with clear system boundaries** - Know what's in and out
2. **Think outputs first** - What does the system produce?
3. **Save frequently** - After each complete chain
4. **Use the GUI order** - Arrow ‚Üí Flow ‚Üí Rectangle ‚Üí Interface ‚Üí Source/Sink
5. **Be patient with subsystem creation** - Follow the exact workflows

### For LLMs:
1. **Provide complete specifications** - All fields for each element
2. **Include theoretical grounding** - Reference established frameworks
3. **Maintain consistency** - Naming patterns and description style
4. **Think pedagogically** - Descriptions should educate
5. **Respect GUI constraints** - Follow exact click sequences

### For Both:
1. **Iterate and refine** - First draft won't be perfect
2. **Document insights** - Capture what you learn
3. **Share templates** - Build library of domain examples
4. **Focus on clarity** - Visual and conceptual
5. **Enjoy the process** - Systems thinking is fun!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Saves not persisting**: Close file in other editors
2. **Subsystem won't attach**: Must connect to existing interface
3. **Central subsystem won't spawn**: Select output sinks, not the subsystems
4. **Spatial interaction not working**: Click boundary ring, not interior
5. **Missing descriptions**: Some fields only visible in certain modes

### BERT Limitations to Remember:
- No signal/control usability type (use Resource)
- Simplified flows have no sub-units or amounts
- Some recursive zoom limitations  
- Desktop app can have WebKit cache issues
