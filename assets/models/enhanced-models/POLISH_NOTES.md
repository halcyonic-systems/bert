# Enhanced Models Polish Notes
*Critical insights for model refinement - Cork Airport Session*

**Created**: 2025-08-04  
**Session**: Cork Airport Ireland, 1hr before boarding  
**Context**: Polishing enhanced models for BERT v0.2.0 Model Browser

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY - Legacy UI/UX Fields

### Models with Legacy Fields (created with old UI):
1. **enhanced-cell.json**
2. **enhanced-organization.json** 
3. **enhanced-solar-panel.json**

### Legacy Fields to Ignore:
- `substance.sub_type` - No longer in simplified flow UI
- `flow.parameters` array - No longer in simplified flow UI
- Empty `unit` fields - No longer in simplified flow UI
- Empty `amount` fields - No longer in simplified flow UI

### Clean Models (created with new simplified UI):
1. **llm.json** ✅
2. **ecosystem.json** ✅
3. **system.json** (Generic System Template) ✅

### BERT Compatibility Note:
These legacy fields don't break anything - BERT should gracefully ignore them. No need for technical cleanup during travel sessions.

## Cell Model Polish Plan (Cork Airport)

### Priority 1: Educational Content Enhancement (30 min)
1. **Main Cell Description**: Currently "A simplified biological cell model" - needs theoretical grounding
2. **Secretion Demands Flow**: Empty description - needs biological context
3. **Cell-Level Equivalence**: Missing - add cross-domain metaphor
4. **Thin Descriptions**: Several organelles need richer educational content

### Deferred Technical Issues:
- ATP Synthase location is actually CORRECT (exports ATP from cell)
- "02" typo in substance.sub_type - legacy field, ignore
- Generic "Interface" labels on internal interfaces - OK for now
- Parameter cleanup - legacy fields, ignore

### Key Insight:
Focus polish efforts on **educational value** and **theoretical grounding** rather than technical field cleanup. The models function perfectly despite legacy fields.

## Strategy for All Models

### For Legacy Models (Cell, Org, Solar Panel):
- Enhance descriptions and educational content
- Add theoretical grounding quotes where appropriate
- Ignore legacy technical fields
- Focus on domain accuracy and teaching value

### For Clean Models (LLM, Ecosystem, System):
- These are already clean - just enhance content
- Add more cross-domain connections
- Ensure theoretical consistency

## Time Management - Cork Airport Session

**Available**: ~1 hour before boarding  
**Focus**: Cell model educational enhancement only  
**Skip**: Technical cleanup, legacy field removal  
**Goal**: Transform functional model → educational masterpiece
