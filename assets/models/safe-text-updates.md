# Safe Text Updates for BERT Models (v0.2.0)

## Issue Discovered
Text updates with apostrophes and special characters caused grey screen rendering issue.
Solution: Use simple ASCII-safe descriptions without special punctuation.

## Safe Updates (Apostrophe-Free Versions)

### 1. bitcoin.json
**Environment Name & Description:**
```json
"name": "Global Financial Network",
"description": "The distributed economic environment where Bitcoin operates as a decentralized monetary system. This includes fiat currency systems, financial institutions, regulatory frameworks, and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin exists within this complex network of value exchange, demonstrating how technological systems can create alternative economic infrastructures independent of traditional institutional control."
```

### 2. ethereum.json  
**Environment Name & Description:**
```json
"name": "Decentralized Computing Ecosystem",
"description": "The distributed computational environment where Ethereum operates as a world computer. This includes decentralized applications, smart contract platforms, DeFi protocols, and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Ethereum demonstrates how blockchain systems can extend beyond simple value transfer to become programmable platforms for decentralized computation and autonomous organization."
```

### 3. cosmos-hub.json
**Environment Name & Description:**
```json
"name": "Inter-Blockchain Communication Network",
"description": "The multi-chain ecosystem where Cosmos Hub operates as an interoperability nexus. This includes sovereign application-specific blockchains, cross-chain communication protocols, and the broader Internet of Blockchains vision. Cosmos Hub demonstrates how specialized hub architectures can enable heterogeneous blockchain networks to exchange value and information while maintaining sovereignty."
```

### 4. solana.json
**Environment Name & Description:**
```json
"name": "High-Performance Blockchain Ecosystem",
"description": "The high-throughput computational environment where Solana operates as a web-scale blockchain. This includes DeFi applications, NFT marketplaces, Web3 gaming platforms, and performance-critical decentralized systems. Solana demonstrates how novel consensus mechanisms and parallel processing can achieve traditional database performance while maintaining decentralization."
```

### 5. interstate.json
**System Name & Description:**
```json
"name": "Interstate Commerce System",
"description": "Complex hierarchical freight transportation network demonstrating Mobus principles of system organization across multiple scales. This model analyzes 6.3 million commodity flow records to reveal how economic systems self-organize through transportation networks. The interstate commerce system exemplifies emergence in socio-technical systems where local shipping decisions create national-scale economic patterns."
```

**Environment Description:**
```json
"name": "North American Economic Infrastructure",
"description": "The North American economic and infrastructure environment including transportation networks, regulatory frameworks, supply chain systems, and market dynamics. This environment shapes how goods flow between states, creating emergent patterns of economic specialization and interdependence. The interstate system demonstrates how physical infrastructure and economic incentives co-evolve to create complex adaptive systems."
```

### 6. ontology.json
**System Name & Description:**
```json
"name": "Systems Ontology Framework",
"description": "Meta-model demonstrating how BERT itself implements formal systems ontology principles. This recursive model shows BERT analyzing its own structure, embodying the concept that systems science must be capable of analyzing itself. The ontology system maps theoretical concepts from Bunge and Mobus to computational implementations, bridging abstract systems theory with practical modeling tools. Demonstrates the recursive nature of systems thinking where the analytical framework can analyze itself."
```

**Environment Description:**
```json
"name": "Theoretical Systems Science Environment",
"description": "The theoretical and computational environment of systems science including formal ontologies, modeling frameworks, and knowledge representation systems. This meta-environment encompasses both the abstract conceptual space of systems theory and the concrete implementation space of software tools. It demonstrates how theoretical frameworks become operational through computational embodiment."
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Removed all apostrophes** - "Mobus's" â†’ "Mobus", possessives reworded
2. **Simplified punctuation** - No smart quotes or special characters
3. **ASCII-safe** - All descriptions use standard ASCII characters only
4. **Maintained meaning** - Content preserved, just safer formatting

## Testing Protocol

1. Apply one model at a time
2. Test loading after each change
3. If any model causes issues, immediately revert that specific file
4. Document which descriptions work and which don't
