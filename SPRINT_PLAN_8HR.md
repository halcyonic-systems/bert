## üîç Assessment Guidelines (Prevent Future Errors)

### **CRITICAL:** Always Do Deep Investigation Before Conclusions

**‚ùå NEVER assume completion based on:**
- Presence of plugins, components, or architecture
- Superficial code searches showing "implementation"
- Pattern matching without functionality verification

**‚úÖ ALWAYS verify completion by:**
1. **Read dedicated status/documentation files** (e.g., `SCREENSHOT_FEATURE_STATUS.md`)
2. **Check actual component implementations** (not just research docs)
3. **Verify compilation AND runtime functionality**
4. **Look for explicit "ISSUES" or "BLOCKERS" sections**
5. **Test branch switching and code execution where possible**

### **Assessment Verification Checklist**
- [ ] Read ALL status documentation files for the feature
- [ ] Examine actual implementation files (not just research)
- [ ] Check for explicit issue documentation
- [ ] Verify compilation status
- [ ] Look for TODO/FIXME comments in key files
- [ ] Check commit messages for "fix", "broken", "issue" keywords

### **Red Flags That Indicate Problems**
- Large file sizes but broken functionality (like 19-22MB blank images)
- Research documents that end with "next steps" or "issues"
- Event handlers that don't respond across platforms
- Warnings about "debugging needed" in status files

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- [UPDATE THROUGHOUT SPRINT]

### What Could Be Improved
- **15:45 CORRECTION:** Initial assessment was severely flawed - need deeper investigation
- **15:45 LESSON:** Read status docs BEFORE making completion assessments

### AI Coordination Insights
- [UPDATE THROUGHOUT SPRINT]

### Process Improvements
- **15:45 ADDED:** Mandatory deep-dive verification before percentage estimates
- **15:45 ADDED:** Check for dedicated status files (e.g., `*_STATUS.md`)

---

## üéØ Next Sprint Planning

### Identified for Next Sprint
- [UPDATE AS IDEAS EMERGE]

### Deferred from This Sprint
- [UPDATE AS SCOPE CHANGES]

---

**üìù Instructions for Use:**
1. Update timestamps as you progress
2. Check off completed items in real-time
3. Add blockers and decisions as they occur
4. Use this as the single source of truth for sprint coordination
5. All AIs should reference and update this file

**üö® Remember:** This is temporary coordination - delete after sprint completion!

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Recovery

### Backup Information
- **Backup Tag:** `sprint-backup-20250620-1452`
- **Backup Commit:** `994151e` (Sprint plan creation)
- **Current Branch:** `main`

### Recovery Options
```bash
# Option 1: Remove just the sprint plan
git revert 994151e

# Option 2: Full rollback to pre-sprint state  
git reset --hard sprint-backup-20250620-1452

# Option 3: Check what changed since backup
git diff sprint-backup-20250620-1452

# Option 4: List all changes since backup
git log --oneline sprint-backup-20250620-1452..HEAD
```

### Safety Rules
1. ‚úÖ Only commit planning/documentation to main (not feature code)
2. ‚úÖ Do actual feature development on feature branches
3. ‚úÖ Keep commits atomic and easily revertible
4. ‚úÖ Backup current state before starting (tag created)
