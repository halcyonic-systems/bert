**📝 Instructions for Use:**
1. Update timestamps as you progress
2. Check off completed items in real-time
3. Add blockers and decisions as they occur
4. Use this as the single source of truth for sprint coordination
5. All AIs should reference and update this file

**🚨 Remember:** This is temporary coordination - delete after sprint completion!

## 🛡️ Safety & Recovery

### Backup Information
- **Backup Tag:** `sprint-backup-20250620-1452`
- **Backup Commit:** `994151e` (Sprint plan creation)
- **Current Branch:** `main`

### Recovery Options
```bash
# Option 1: Remove just the sprint plan
git revert 994151e

# Option 2: Full rollback to pre-sprint state  
git reset --hard sprint-backup-20250620-1452

# Option 3: Check what changed since backup
git diff sprint-backup-20250620-1452

# Option 4: List all changes since backup
git log --oneline sprint-backup-20250620-1452..HEAD
```

### Safety Rules
1. ✅ Only commit planning/documentation to main (not feature code)
2. ✅ Do actual feature development on feature branches
3. ✅ Keep commits atomic and easily revertible
4. ✅ Backup current state before starting (tag created)
