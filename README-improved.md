## What is BERT?

BERT helps you **understand complex systems** by breaking them down visually. Whether you're analyzing a business process, ecosystem, or technology stack, BERT provides a structured approach to:

- **Map system components** and their relationships
- **Identify key flows** of information, energy, and materials  
- **Understand boundaries** and interfaces
- **Document insights** in a standardized format

**Perfect for**: Systems analysts, researchers, consultants, strategists, and anyone who needs to understand how complex things work.

## About

BERT implements **Deep Systems Analysis** methodology from [Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling and Design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-93482-8) by George Mobus. 

Created to address limitations in traditional modeling tools, BERT preserves the nuance and complexity that abstract models often lose.
