# What is System Language?

System language (SL) is formal language that can be used to describe and analyze any system of interest. It is designed to help humans communicate with each other and with machines using a common set of general terms which collectively capture the essential aspects of systemness. It supports holistic and detailed sytems analysis in all domains including science, business, and government. By unifying the linguistic, graphical, and mathematical aspects of systems through a common ontology, it aims to be speakable, viewable, and â€œcomputable. 

By providing systems researchers with a shared language that facilitates the analysis of systems in interoperable natural language, graphical, and mathematical terms, SL can play a key role in supporting transdisciplinary research aimed at discovering abd validating universal scienitfic principles applying to systems in general. 

[George Mobus](https://directory.tacoma.uw.edu/employee/gmobus) desrbibes the vision for SL in [Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling and Design](https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Science-Theory-Analysis-Modeling/dp/3030934810) chapters 3 and 4. 

SL is derived from a set of principles, an ontology, and a formal mathematical definition of system which inform the language's syntax and semantics. The following sections describe on how each of these elements will inform the development of SL as implemented in BERT.
