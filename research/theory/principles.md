# 12 Principles of Systems Science
[Principles of Systems Science](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-1920-8) proposes twelve principles that are relevant and universally applicable to any system of interest in any scientific domain. This (non-exhaustive) list was derived from a synthesis of decades of historical general systems research dating back to the birth of General Systems Theory in the 1950s, and recent developments in mdoern complexity and systems science. 






1. **Systemness:** Bounded networks of relations among parts constitute a holistic unit. Systems interact with other systems, forming yet larger systems. The Universe is composed of systems of systems.

2. Systems are **processes** organized in structural and functional **hierarchies**.

3. Systems are themselves and can be represented abstractly as, **networks** of relations between components.

4. Systems are **dynamic** on multiple time scales.

5. Systems exhibit various kinds and levels of **complexity**.

6. Systems **evolve** to accommodate long-term changes in their environments.

7. Systems encode **knowledge** and receive and send **information**.

8. Systems have **governance** subsystems to achieve stability.

9. Systems contain **models** of other systems (e.g., simple built-in protocols for interaction with other systems and up to complex anticipatory models).

10. Sufficiently complex, adaptive systems can contain **self-model**s.

11. Systems can be **understood** (a corollary of #9)—Science.

12. Systems can be **improved** (a corollary of #6)—Engineering.
