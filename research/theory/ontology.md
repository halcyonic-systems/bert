# Systems Ontology

GST founder Ludwig von Bertalanffy identified “systems ontology” as the field dedicated to determining “what is meant by ‘system’ and how systems are realized at the various levels of the world of observation.” In Systems Science: Theory, Analysis, Modeling, and Design (2022) George Mobus outlines a formal systems ontology — a set of terms naming what exists in the domain of systems.

The ontology is derived from the [12 principles of systems science](https://github.com/halcyonic-systems/bert/blob/main/research/theory/principles.md) and provides a set of base terms describing what fundamental components exist in all systems and gives us a basic language for discussing all relevant aspects of systemness.

# Systems Ontology Summary Report

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This ontology formalizes the fundamental concepts of systems theory based on four elemental substances: Matter, Energy, Information, and Knowledge. The primary purposes are to:

1. Provide a structured vocabulary for systems concepts
2. Capture how systems emerge from fundamental elements
3. Define atomic work processes and their roles
4. Support analysis of complex systems through clear hierarchical organization

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 Core Classes

The ontology is organized around these primary classes:

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| FundamentalElement | The base substances (Matter, Energy, Information, Knowledge) from which systems emerge |
| System | A coherent whole that emerges from fundamental element interactions |
| AtomicWorkProcess | Basic transformation processes that manipulate fundamental elements |
| Environment | The context in which systems exist and operate |
| Input/Output | Flows of fundamental elements into and out of systems |
| Boundary | Interface between system and environment |
| ComplexAdaptiveSystem | Systems that can adapt to environmental changes |

### 2.2 Atomic Work Processes

The ontology defines several atomic work processes:

- AmplifyingProcess
- BufferingProcess 
- CombiningProcess
- CopyingProcess
- ImpedingProcess
- InvertingProcess
- ModulatingProcess
- PropellingProcess
- SensingProcess
- SplittingProcess

### 2.3 Key Object Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| emergesFrom | Links systems and components to fundamental elements |
| consistsOf | Relates flows to their fundamental elements |
| consumesEnergy | Links processes to energy consumption |
| interactsWith | Defines component interactions |
| transformsFundamentalElement | Links processes to element transformation |

## 3. Core Concepts

1. **Fundamental Elements**: All systems emerge from configurations of Matter, Energy, Information, and Knowledge

2. **Atomic Work Processes**: Basic transformative operations that manipulate fundamental elements

3. **System Boundaries**: Emerge from fundamental element configurations to regulate flows

4. **Flows**: Consist of fundamental elements moving between systems and environment

5. **Complex Adaptation**: Systems can reconfigure their internal relationships of fundamental elements

## 4. Usage Guidelines

This ontology can be used to:

1. Analyze how systems emerge from fundamental elements
2. Decompose complex systems into atomic work processes
3. Track flows of fundamental elements through system boundaries
4. Model system adaptation and evolution
5. Support systems engineering and analysis

## 5. Future Development

Areas for potential expansion include:

1. Additional atomic work process patterns
2. More detailed flow specifications
3. Enhanced complex adaptive system properties
4. Integration with domain-specific ontologies
5. Quantitative metrics for emergence and complexity
