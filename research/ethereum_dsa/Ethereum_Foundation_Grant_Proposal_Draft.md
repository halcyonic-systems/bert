# Deep Systems Analysis for Ethereum

## Project Abstract

Ethereum's ecosystem has grown into a complex web of interacting components – smart contracts, validators, users, and layer-2 solutions – yet we lack rigorous methods to understand how these pieces fit together and influence each other. This project will adapt our successful Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) approach from Bitcoin to map Ethereum's architecture, creating a formal framework that captures both structure and dynamics. By translating this model into cadCAD simulations, we'll enable protocol designers to visualize system behaviors, test proposed changes, and anticipate unintended consequences before implementation. This work aims to transform how we think about Ethereum's evolution by making its complexity more comprehensible and its future more predictable.

## Objectives

1. Map Ethereum's component architecture through a comprehensive DSA model that captures the unique features of smart contracts, the EVM, and validator interactions
2. Develop formal specifications for key Ethereum interfaces and communication pathways
3. Build cadCAD simulation models that can predict system-level responses to protocol changes
4. Create visualization tools that make complex Ethereum dynamics accessible to researchers and developers
5. Design modular testing frameworks for evaluating proposed protocol upgrades and policy interventions
6. Validate model accuracy against real-world Ethereum network data

## Outcomes

This project will change how we understand and evolve Ethereum:

1. **Better protocol decisions**: Protocol designers will gain tools to test proposals before implementation, identifying potential problems early and reducing costly mistakes
2. **Deeper economic insights**: By modeling incentive structures in staking, MEV, and fee markets, we can pinpoint inefficiencies and optimize network operations
3. **Stronger security**: System-level modeling will reveal potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities that remain hidden when examining components in isolation
4. **More meaningful decentralization**: Our frameworks will help measure and understand the factors that actually drive validator decentralization
5. **Broader accessibility**: Visual representations of Ethereum's inner workings will make complex mechanisms understandable to a wider community
6. **Accelerated research**: The open-source tooling will give researchers powerful starting points for specialized investigations

## Grant Scope

We'll focus on four interconnected areas:

1. **Methodology adaptation**: Evolving our Bitcoin-proven DSA approach to handle Ethereum's unique architecture and greater complexity

2. **System mapping**: Creating detailed models of Ethereum's key subsystems:
   - Consensus mechanisms and validator behaviors
   - EVM execution and state management
   - Data availability infrastructure
   - Smart contract ecosystems and composability

3. **Flow dynamics**: Tracing how resources and information move through the system:
   - Gas as both economic signal and resource allocation mechanism
   - State transitions and their propagation effects
   - Stake movements and validator incentive responses
   - MEV capture and distribution pathways

4. **Simulation development**: Building computational models that can predict:
   - How proposed protocol changes might affect different stakeholders
   - Where system bottlenecks might emerge under various conditions
   - How attackers might exploit unexpected interactions between components

The final deliverables will include interactive DSA models, simulation code, documentation, and case studies demonstrating practical insights.

## Related Work

This proposal builds directly on our previous work mapping Bitcoin's system architecture and behavior through DSA models. That project demonstrated how seemingly simple protocol rules can create complex emergent behaviors – insights that would have been difficult to discover through traditional analysis.

Our approach also builds upon significant research in Ethereum modeling, particularly recent work by Kraner et al. (2023) on agent-based modeling of Ethereum consensus and Karra et al. (2023) on utility-based consensus frameworks. These studies provide valuable methodologies for modeling validator behaviors and economic incentives, which we'll integrate with our systems-level approach. I've prepared supplementary materials detailing how these methods will be synthesized with DSA techniques in the project GitHub repository.

Our approach complements several priority areas in the Ethereum Foundation's 2025 research agenda:

1. **Economic mechanism design**: Our models can help evaluate:
   - How issuance changes might affect validator composition and security
   - Whether proposed multi-proposer protocols reduce MEV extraction
   - How block space auction designs impact network participants
   - The second-order effects of inclusion list implementations

2. **Protocol evolution**: We can simulate:
   - Security guarantees of different finality protocols
   - Censorship resistance under various builder/proposer configurations
   - Fee market dynamics and their effects on users and L2s
   - Data availability tradeoffs in blob pricing models

3. **Network security**: Our system-level approach helps:
   - Detect potential attack vectors from unexpected component interactions
   - Analyze dependency risks across the ecosystem
   - Model network health under stress conditions

Most existing Ethereum research focuses narrowly on specific components (gas markets, validator incentives, etc.) without capturing how these elements interact. Our holistic approach fills this gap by modeling these connections and revealing emergent properties that component-level analysis misses.

**Shingai Thornton**
Principal Researcher

I've been deeply involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem since 2012, including early participation in Ethereum and the original DAO. My academic background includes a B.A. in Social Sciences from the University of Southern California, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Systems Science at Binghamton University. 

My work combines practical crypto experience with formal systems methodologies, allowing me to bridge technical implementation details with higher-level systemic behaviors. The Bitcoin DSA analysis demonstrated in this project's background materials represents my approach to understanding complex blockchain systems through decomposition, boundary analysis, and flow mapping.

As principal researcher, I'll leverage Ethereum-based collaboration tools such as Aragon, ResearchHub, and Snapshot to bring on specialized technical support as needed. This approach allows for flexible scaling of expertise while maintaining the project's coherence under unified direction.

## Background

My work on Bitcoin systems modeling provides the methodological foundation for this project. I've created comprehensive system models of Bitcoin using Deep Systems Analysis techniques, which have been successfully translated into cadCAD simulations that demonstrate emergent network behaviors. 

The key resources demonstrating this foundation include:
- **[Bitcoin Deep Systems Analysis](/research/deep%20systems%20analysis/bitcoin_dsa.md)**: Comprehensive DSA breakdown of Bitcoin system architecture
- **[Bitcoin cadCAD Simulation](/simulations/bitcoinsims.ipynb)**: Computational model implementing the DSA approach
- **[Bitcoin BERT Model](/btc.json)**: Structured representation of Bitcoin system in the BERT tool

To extend this approach to Ethereum, I've conducted an extensive literature review of Ethereum modeling methodologies, with particular focus on consensus mechanisms, validator economics, and gas markets. I've analyzed key papers including:
- **[Kraner et al. (2023)](/simulations/Kraner%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Agent-Based%20Modelling%20of%20Ethereum%20Consensus.pdf)**: Agent-based models of Ethereum consensus
- **[Karra et al. (2023)](/simulations/Karra%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20An%20Agent-Based%20Model%20Framework%20for%20Utility-Based%20C.pdf)**: Utility-based consensus frameworks

I've begun integrating these insights into preliminary Ethereum system models, available in the GitHub repository. These resources demonstrate how I plan to adapt and extend DSA techniques to address Ethereum's unique characteristics and complexity.

## Methodology

   - User transaction requests and their characteristics
   - Application computational demands
   - Physical resource constraints
   - Developer contributions and protocol evolution
