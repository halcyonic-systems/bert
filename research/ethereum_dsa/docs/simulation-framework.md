# Ethereum Simulation Framework

This document outlines the simulation framework being developed to model Ethereum using Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) principles. The framework leverages cadCAD (Complex Adaptive Dynamics Computer-Aided Design) to create modular, composable simulations of Ethereum's key components and their interactions.

## Simulation Architecture

The simulation framework follows a modular architecture that separates different aspects of the Ethereum system:

### Core Components

1. **System Parameters**
   - Network configuration values
   - Economic parameters
   - Protocol constants
   - Simulation settings

2. **State Variables**
   - System state metrics
   - Agent state data
   - Resource levels
   - Performance indicators

3. **Policies**
   - Agent decision functions
   - Protocol rules
   - Economic mechanisms
   - Network behaviors

4. **State Update Functions**
   - Consensus updates
   - Execution processing
   - Economic calculations
   - Network propagation

### Simulation Workflow

The simulation follows the standard cadCAD process flow:

1. **Initialization**: Set up system parameters and initial state
2. **Policy Execution**: Apply policy functions to current state
3. **State Updates**: Calculate new state based on policy outputs
4. **Metrics Collection**: Record key indicators and measurements
5. **Iteration**: Repeat process for specified time steps or until convergence
