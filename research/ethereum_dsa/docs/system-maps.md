# Ethereum System Maps

This document presents preliminary system maps for Ethereum created using the Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) approach. These maps decompose Ethereum into its key components, identify system boundaries, map interfaces between subsystems, and trace resource and information flows.

## System Boundary Definition

### Ethereum System Boundary

The Ethereum system boundary encompasses all components that directly participate in the consensus, execution, and data availability processes of the Ethereum network. The boundary separates:

**Internal Components**:
- Consensus layer nodes (validators)
- Execution layer nodes
- Mempool infrastructure
- Smart contract execution environment
- Data availability systems
- Protocol code and specifications

**External Entities**:
- Users (transaction senders/receivers)
- Application developers
- Core protocol developers
- Infrastructure providers
- Layer 2 solutions
- Computing hardware and resources
- Regulatory environment

### System-Environment Interfaces

The key interfaces across the system boundary include:

1. **User Transaction Interface**
   - Transaction submissions from users
   - Transaction confirmations to users
   - Fee payments and economic signals

2. **Developer Interface**
   - Protocol upgrades and EIPs
   - Smart contract deployments
   - Application integrations

3. **Infrastructure Interface**
   - Computation resources
   - Network bandwidth
   - Storage capacity

4. **L2 Interface**
   - Data availability requirements
   - Settlement transactions
   - Cross-layer messaging

## Subsystem Decomposition

### Core Subsystems

1. **Consensus Layer**
   - Validator management
   - Block proposal
   - Attestation processing
   - Fork choice rule
   - Finality gadget

2. **Execution Layer**
   - EVM execution
   - State management
   - Transaction processing
   - Gas accounting
   - World state updates

3. **Mempool**
   - Transaction validation
   - Transaction propagation
   - Fee assessment
   - Transaction ordering

4. **Data Availability**
   - Blob storage
   - Data verification
   - Sampling protocols
   - Sharding mechanisms

5. **Smart Contract Environment**
   - Contract execution
   - Contract storage
   - Contract interactions
   - Oracle integrations

6. **Network Layer**
   - Peer discovery
   - Message propagation
   - Gossip protocols
   - Network health monitoring

## Interface Mapping

### Consensus-Execution Interface

The interface between consensus and execution layers includes:

- Block proposals from consensus to execution
- State validation from execution to consensus
- Transaction execution requests
- Execution results and receipts
- Fork choice information

This interface is crucial for Ethereum's separation of concerns architecture, especially post-Merge.

### Execution-Mempool Interface

The execution layer interacts with the mempool through:

- Transaction validation requests
- Validation results
- Block inclusion requests
- Transaction ordering signals
- Fee market information

### Data Availability Interfaces

The data availability subsystem interfaces with:

- **Consensus layer**: Blob commitments, data root verification
- **Execution layer**: State access and verification
- **L2 systems**: Data posting and availability proofs
- **Network layer**: Data propagation and sampling requests

## Resource Flows

### ETH Flow

ETH moves through the system as:

1. **Value Transfer**: Direct transfers between accounts
2. **Fee Payment**: Transaction fees paid to validators
3. **Staking Deposit**: Collateral for validator participation
4. **Rewards**: Issuance to validators for participation
5. **Slashing**: Penalties for protocol violations

### Gas Flow

Gas serves as both an economic mechanism and resource allocation tool:

1. **Computation Pricing**: Cost signal for EVM operations
2. **Spam Prevention**: Minimum cost for network access
3. **Prioritization Signal**: Fee market for transaction ordering
4. **Resource Management**: Block gas limits for network capacity

### Data Flow

Data flows through Ethereum in several forms:

1. **Transaction Data**: User operation requests
2. **State Data**: Account balances and contract storage
3. **Blob Data**: Large data storage for L2 systems
4. **Consensus Messages**: Attestations and block proposals
5. **Peer Communication**: Network discovery and health signals

## System Dynamics and Feedback Loops

### Key Feedback Loops

1. **Fee Market Dynamics**
   - Increased demand → Higher gas prices → Reduced demand
   - Sustained high demand → Block space expansion proposals

2. **Validator Economics**
   - Higher staking rewards → More validators → Lower rewards per validator
   - Security risks → Slashing events → Reduced validator participation

3. **Network Performance**
   - Higher usage → Congestion → Increased fees → Layer 2 migration
   - Network upgrades → Improved capacity → Increased usage

4. **Protocol Evolution**
   - User needs → Protocol proposals → Implementation → New user needs
   - Security issues → Mitigation proposals → Protocol hardening

## Preliminary Subsystem Models

### Consensus Layer Model

The consensus layer can be modeled as a network of validator agents with:

- Individual staking positions
- Attestation behaviors
- Block proposal strategies
- Network connectivity patterns
- Slashing and reward accounting

Key state variables include validator set composition, attestation participation rates, and finality distance.

### Execution Layer Model

The execution layer can be modeled as a state transition system with:

- Transaction queue management
- Gas accounting
- EVM execution
- State storage
- Account management

Key state variables include gas prices, block utilization, and state growth rates.

### Fee Market Model

The fee market can be modeled as an economic system with:

- User demand curves
- Priority fee competition
- Base fee adjustment mechanism
- Validator inclusion strategies
- MEV extraction opportunities

Key state variables include base fee levels, priority fee distributions, and block space utilization.

## Next Steps

These preliminary system maps will be refined through:

1. **Formal Specification**: Creating rigorous definitions of components and interfaces
2. **Quantitative Modeling**: Developing mathematical models of key relationships
3. **Data Collection**: Gathering empirical data to calibrate model parameters
4. **Simulation Development**: Implementing cadCAD models for system components
5. **Validation**: Comparing model predictions with actual Ethereum behaviors

The next phase will focus on translating these conceptual models into computational simulations that can predict system responses to proposed changes and interventions.
