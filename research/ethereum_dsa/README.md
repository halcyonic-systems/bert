# Ethereum Deep Systems Analysis

This repository contains research materials, models, and simulations supporting the application of Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) to Ethereum. The work builds on previous DSA models of Bitcoin, extending the methodology to address Ethereum's unique architecture and complexity.

## Project Overview

Deep Systems Analysis is a methodological approach for understanding complex systems through:

1. System boundary identification
2. Component decomposition
3. Interface mapping
4. Flow analysis
5. Feedback loop identification

This project applies these techniques to Ethereum, creating formal models and simulations that help predict system behaviors and evaluate proposed protocol changes.

## Research Foundation

This work builds upon several key research papers:

### Agent-Based Modeling of Ethereum Consensus (Kraner et al., 2023)

This paper develops an agent-based model of Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, modeling validators as individual agents with varying behaviors and strategies. Key insights include:

- Mechanisms for modeling validator behaviors and strategies
- Approaches to simulating network conditions and validator interactions
- Frameworks for analyzing emergent network behaviors

### Utility-Based Consensus Frameworks (Karra et al., 2023)

This research creates a utility-based ABM framework specifically for studying crypto economic systems, with a focus on:

- Modeling agents with heterogeneous preferences and utility functions
- Integrating economic incentives with blockchain consensus mechanisms
- Analyzing rational decision-making in decentralized networks

### Deep Systems Analysis of Bitcoin (Thornton, 2023)

My previous work applying DSA to Bitcoin established the methodological foundation, demonstrating:

- Techniques for system decomposition and boundary analysis
- Methods for mapping interfaces and flows between components
- Approaches to translating system models into cadCAD simulations

## Current Progress

This repository documents ongoing work to extend these methodologies to Ethereum, including:

- Preliminary system maps of Ethereum's core components
- Interface specifications for key subsystem interactions
- Initial cadCAD model structures for simulating Ethereum dynamics

## Research Questions

The project aims to address several key questions:

1. How do economic incentives in Ethereum's proof-of-stake system influence validator behaviors?
2. What feedback loops exist between gas prices, user behaviors, and network performance?
3. How might proposed protocol changes affect system stability and security?
4. What emergent behaviors might arise from interactions between execution and consensus layers?

## Relationship to BERT Framework

This research leverages and extends the BERT tool for systems modeling. BERT provides the diagrammatic and conceptual framework for capturing Ethereum's system architecture, while the cadCAD simulations translate these models into computational representations.

## Contributing

This research is currently in progress as part of an Ethereum Foundation grant proposal. Once funded, we welcome contributions from researchers and developers interested in systems modeling and Ethereum.
