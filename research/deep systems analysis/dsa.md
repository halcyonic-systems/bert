# Why Deep Systems Analysis?

Deep Systems Analysis (DSA) refers to a methodology for helping scientists deeply understand complex systems and then constructing models based on this deep understanding. It is meant to serve as an alternative to the traditional approach to modeling in science.

The traditional approach to understanding systems in science is to use models as a tool to understand systems outside of deep analysis. Preliminary observations of a system’s behavior are made and a mathematical black box model is constructed and solved to produce a result that can be tested against the behavior of the real system under experimentally controlled or naturally occurring conditions. This tradition is based on the idea that we only need to construct models to answer specific questions that are of interest to the modeler and should’t involve details considered to outside the scope of those questions. 

The DSA approach rejects this mindset and proposes a methodology based on a formal ontology of systems and formal framework for understanding complex systems that can guide the exploration of system properties in analysis and assist in the designs of systems artifacts. This methodology can be used to acquire knowledge of how things in the Universe work. It rests on understanding “things” as systems, and recognizing that systems interact with other systems and in doing so form a larger, encompassing supra-system, that systems are composed of subsystems — all the way down to the atomistic level.

# DSA Tools

DSA is designed to be augmented by a formal System Language (SL) that is flexible enough to  support systems analysis in all domains.

Empowering systems scientists to embrace and refine DSA depends on the development of a suite of computational tools that helps scientist and analysts diagrammatically capture knowledge of concrete systems in the world as they iteratively come to understand them. From this place of deep understanding, they can then construct deep causal models and generate a simulation.

BERT is a prototype of the first application designed specifically to help systems scientists perform DSA.
