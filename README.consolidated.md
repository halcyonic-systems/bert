## What is BERT?

BERT helps you **understand complex systems** by breaking them down visually. Whether you're analyzing a business process, ecosystem, or technology stack, BERT provides a structured approach to:

- **Map system components** and their relationships
- **Identify key flows** of information, energy, and materials  
- **Understand boundaries** and interfaces
- **Document insights** in a standardized format

Transform complex systems into clear, actionable insights with a structured methodology based on systems theory.

## 📖 Background

BERT implements the System Language (SL) framework for bounded entity reasoning. It provides a visual interface for modeling complex adaptive systems through their boundaries, flows, and relationships.

The software combines proven systems engineering principles with modern visualization techniques to create a powerful tool for understanding complexity.
