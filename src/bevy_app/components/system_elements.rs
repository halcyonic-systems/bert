//! # System Elements Module
//!
//! This module defines the core system elements that make up a BERT system model,
//! implementing the System Language (SL) framework for bounded entity reasoning.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! System elements are the fundamental building blocks that represent different components
//! of a complex adaptive system:
//!
//! - **Systems**: Bounded entities with internal structure and behavior
//! - **Interfaces**: Connection points that define system boundaries
//! - **Flows**: Interactions that move substances between system elements
//! - **External Entities**: Sources and sinks outside the system boundary
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - [`SystemElement`]: Base enumeration defining all element types
//! - [`System`]: Core system component with boundary and complexity properties
//! - [`Flow`]: Interaction component representing substance movement
//! - [`Interface`]: Boundary component for system connections
//! - [`ExternalEntity`]: Component for sources and sinks
//!
//! ## Usage Patterns
//!
//! System elements are typically created through spawn bundles and manipulated
//! via Bevy's Entity Component System (ECS). Each element type has specific
//! visual representations and behavioral properties defined by their components.
//!
//! ## System Language Implementation
//!
//! This module implements Layer 2 (Formal Specification) of the System Language
//! framework, providing the mathematical foundation for system modeling through
//! structured component definitions.

///
/// # System Language Mapping
///
/// - **System**: Bounded entities (circles) representing complex adaptive systems
/// - **Interface**: Boundary components (rectangles) defining system interaction points
/// - **Interaction**: Flow connections (lines with arrows) representing substance movement
/// - **External Entity**: Environmental actors (partially enclosed rectangles) as sources/sinks
///
/// # Visual Representation
///
/// Each element type has specific geometric properties and rendering behaviors

/// let system = SystemElement::System;
/// let interface = SystemElement::Interface;
/// let flow = SystemElement::Interaction;
