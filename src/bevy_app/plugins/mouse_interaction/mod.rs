//! # Mouse Interaction Plugin
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive mouse interaction capabilities for BERT's
//! visual system modeling interface, including entity selection, dragging, and
//! hierarchical interaction management.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The mouse interaction system integrates with Bevy's picking system to provide:
//!
//! - **Entity Selection**: Click-based selection with multi-select support
//! - **Drag and Drop**: Position manipulation of system elements
//! - **Hierarchical Picking**: Parent-child relationship aware interactions
//! - **Selection Management**: Centralized selection state and operations
//!
//! ## Interaction Flow
//!
//! ```
//! Mouse Input → Screen-to-World → Entity Picking → Selection/Drag → State Update
//!     ↓              ↓               ↓              ↓            ↓
//! Raw Events → World Position → Entity Detection → Actions → Component Updates
//! ```
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - [`MouseInteractionPlugin`]: Main plugin providing all interaction systems
//! - [`PickSelection`]: Component marking entities as selectable and tracking selection state
//! - [`DragPosition`]: Event for communicating drag operations to entity systems
//! - [`Selection`]: Global selection state resource
//! - [`Dragging`]: Drag operation state tracking
//!
//! ## Usage Patterns
//!
//! ### Basic Entity Selection
//! ```rust
//! use bert::mouse_interaction::{PickSelection, Selection};
//! 
//! // Make an entity selectable
//! commands.entity(entity).insert(PickSelection::default());
//! 
//! // Check if entity is selected
//! if pick_selection.is_selected {
//!     // Handle selected entity
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Hierarchical Interaction
//! ```rust
//! use bert::mouse_interaction::{PickParent, PickTarget};
//! 
//! // Child entity that selects its parent when clicked
//! commands.entity(child).insert(PickParent);
//! 
//! // Proxy entity that selects a different target
//! commands.entity(proxy).insert(PickTarget { target: actual_entity });
//! ```
//!
//! ## Selection Behavior
//!
//! - **Single Click**: Select entity (deselect others)
//! - **Shift+Click**: Toggle entity selection (multi-select)
//! - **Escape**: Deselect all entities
//! - **Drag**: Move selected entities
//!
//! ## Integration Points
//!
//! The plugin integrates with:
//! - Bevy's picking system for entity detection
//! - Transform hierarchy for coordinate conversion
//! - Event system for drag position communication
//! - Visibility system for automatic deselection of hidden entities

/// Main plugin providing comprehensive mouse interaction capabilities for BERT.
///
/// `MouseInteractionPlugin` integrates mouse input handling, entity selection,
/// drag operations, and selection management into a cohesive interaction system
/// that supports the visual manipulation of system models.
///
/// # System Architecture
///
/// The plugin orchestrates several interconnected systems:
///
/// 1. **Input Processing**: Converts screen coordinates to world coordinates
/// 2. **Interaction Detection**: Identifies entities under mouse cursor
/// 3. **Selection Management**: Handles single and multi-entity selection
/// 4. **Drag Operations**: Manages entity position manipulation
/// 5. **State Synchronization**: Maintains consistent selection state
///
/// # Resource Management
///
/// The plugin manages several global resources:
/// - Mouse position tracking in world coordinates
/// - Current selection set with multi-select support
/// - Drag operation state and thresholds
/// - Selection enablement for context-sensitive behavior
///
/// # Event Integration
///
/// Uses Bevy's event system for:
/// - Drag position updates for entity movement
/// - Debug selection information (when debug features enabled)
/// - Integration with other BERT systems
///
/// # Usage
///
/// Add to your Bevy app to enable mouse interactions:
/// ```rust
/// use bert::mouse_interaction::MouseInteractionPlugin;
/// 
/// app.add_plugins(MouseInteractionPlugin);
/// ```
///
/// # See Also
///
/// - [`PickSelection`]: Component for making entities selectable
/// - [`DragPosition`]: Event for handling drag operations
/// - [`Selection`]: Resource containing current selection state

/// `PickParent` enables hierarchical selection where child entities can be used

///
/// # Hierarchical Selection
///
/// When an entity with `PickParent` is clicked:
/// 1. The mouse interaction system identifies the clicked entity
/// 2. Looks up the entity's parent using Bevy's hierarchy
/// 3. Applies selection operations to the parent entity instead
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Visual components of complex system entities
/// - UI elements that should select their containing system
/// - Decoration or annotation entities that belong to larger entities
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use bert::mouse_interaction::{PickSelection, PickParent};
///
/// // Create a parent-child relationship with hierarchical selection
/// let parent = commands.spawn(PickSelection::default()).id();
/// let child = commands.spawn(PickParent)
///     .set_parent(parent)
///     .id();
/// 
/// // Clicking the child will select the parent
/// ```

/// # Requirements
///
/// Entities with `PickParent` must have a parent in Bevy's hierarchy system.

#[derive(Component, Copy, Clone, Eq, PartialEq, Reflect, Debug, Default)]

pub struct PickParent;

/// Component redirecting selection to a specific target entity.
///
/// `PickTarget` enables proxy selection where clicking one entity results in
/// selecting a different, explicitly specified target entity. This provides
/// more flexibility than `PickParent` by allowing arbitrary selection targets.
///
/// # Proxy Selection
///
/// When an entity with `PickTarget` is clicked:
/// 1. The mouse interaction system identifies the clicked entity
/// 2. Uses the specified target entity for selection operations
/// 3. Applies selection state to the target entity
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - UI buttons that select specific system entities
/// - Visual proxies for entities that are not directly clickable
/// - Interface elements that represent remote or hidden entities
/// - Delegation patterns where multiple clickable areas select the same target
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use bert::mouse_interaction::{PickSelection, PickTarget};
///
/// // Create a target entity
/// let target = commands.spawn(PickSelection::default()).id();
///
/// // Create a proxy that selects the target when clicked
/// let proxy = commands.spawn(PickTarget { target }).id();
///
/// // Clicking the proxy will select the target entity
/// ```
///
/// # Target Validation
///
/// The target entity should exist and typically should have a `PickSelection`
/// component to participate in the selection system.

/// System function for deselecting all currently selected entities.
///
/// `deselect_all` clears the selection state of all entities with `PickSelection`
/// components, typically triggered by the Escape key or other global deselection
/// events.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This function is automatically called by the mouse interaction systems, but
/// can also be used manually:
/// ```rust
/// use bert::mouse_interaction::deselect_all;
///
/// app.add_systems(Update, deselect_all.run_if(some_condition));
/// ```
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `query`: Mutable query for all entities with `PickSelection` components
///
/// # Returns
///
/// This function returns `()` (unit type) and operates through side effects.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function does not return errors.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Does not panic under normal operation.
///
/// # See Also
///
/// - [`do_deselect_all`]: The underlying implementation function
/// - [`SelectionEnabled`]: Resource that can disable this functionality

///
/// `do_deselect_all` is the core implementation for clearing selection state
/// across all entities. It's separated from the system function to allow
/// reuse in other contexts without the query parameter constraints.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `pick_selection_query`: Mutable query for entities with `PickSelection`
///
/// # Returns
///
/// This function returns `()` (unit type) and operates through side effects.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function does not return errors.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Does not panic under normal operation.
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// Iterates through all entities with `PickSelection` components and sets
/// their `is_selected` field to `false`. This operation respects the
/// `NoDeselect` component by only operating on the provided query.

/// System function to disable mouse selection functionality.
///
/// `disable_selection` sets the global `SelectionEnabled` resource to `false`,
/// preventing any selection operations from occurring. This is useful during
/// modes where selection should be temporarily disabled.
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Flow terminal selection mode
/// - Modal dialog interactions
/// - Drawing or annotation modes
/// - Any context where selection would interfere with other operations
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use bert::mouse_interaction::disable_selection;
///
/// // Disable selection during a specific mode
/// app.add_systems(OnEnter(DrawingMode), disable_selection);
/// ```
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `selection_enabled`: Mutable resource for controlling selection state
///
/// # Returns
///
/// This function returns `()` (unit type) and operates through side effects.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function does not return errors.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Does not panic under normal operation.
///

///
/// `enable_selection` sets the global `SelectionEnabled` resource to `true`
/// and clears any ongoing drag operations. This ensures a clean state when
/// re-enabling selection after it was disabled.
///
/// # State Reset
///
/// In addition to enabling selection, this function:
/// - Clears any hovered entity state
/// - Resets drag operation flags
/// - Ensures clean interaction state
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// use bert::mouse_interaction::enable_selection;
///
/// // Re-enable selection when exiting a special mode
/// app.add_systems(OnExit(DrawingMode), enable_selection);
/// ```
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `selection_enabled`: Mutable resource for controlling selection state
/// - `dragging`: Mutable resource for drag operation state (reset to default)

/// # Errors
///
/// This function does not return errors.
///

///
/// `deselect_when_invisible` monitors visibility changes and automatically
/// deselects entities that become invisible. This prevents having selected
/// entities that the user cannot see, which would be confusing.
///
/// # Visibility Integration
///
/// Uses Bevy's `InheritedVisibility` component to detect when entities
/// become invisible through:
/// - Direct visibility changes
/// - Parent visibility changes (inheritance)
/// - Layer or rendering visibility changes
///
/// # Change Detection
///
/// The system uses Bevy's change detection (`Changed<InheritedVisibility>`)
/// to efficiently process only entities whose visibility has changed,
/// minimizing performance impact.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This system runs automatically as part of the mouse interaction plugin.
/// No manual configuration is required.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `selection_query`: Query for entities with both `PickSelection` and
///   `InheritedVisibility`, filtered to only changed visibility
///
/// # Returns
///
/// This function returns `()` (unit type) and operates through side effects.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function does not return errors.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Does not panic under normal operation.
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// When an entity's visibility changes to invisible (`!visibility.get()`),
/// its selection state is cleared. Entities becoming visible are not
/// automatically selected.
